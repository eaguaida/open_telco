If Configure sets up the mapping of data/analytics to outbound notification endpoints, then Deconfigure would stop or remove those mappings.\n\nOption B is the most logical answer as it describes stopping the mapping functionality, which is what a deconfigure operation would do.\n\nANSWER: B",

Extended addresses aren't specifically required or prohibited for GTS functionality.\n\n2. **Device capability**: Not all devices need guaranteed time slots. GTS is an optional feature that devices use when they need guaranteed bandwidth or latency guarantees.\n\n3. **Mandatory vs Optional**: The key word here is \"required.\" GTS Request commands are NOT mandatory for all devices. They are only sent when:\n   - A device actually needs a guaranteed time slot\n   - The device is capable of requesting GTS\n   - The device chooses to use this optional feature\n\n4. Looking at the options:\n   - A) Incorrect - short addresses are actually used for GTS\n   - B) Incorrect - extended addressing is not a requirement\n   - C) This seems to be a tautology but may be hinting that only capable devices send them\n   - D) Incorrect - not all devices are required to send GTS requests\n   - E) This might be correct if we interpret \"required\" strictly - no devices are actually REQUIRED to send GTS requests; it's optional\n\nSince GTS is an optional feature and devices only send GTS Request commands when they choose to request a guaranteed time slot, no devices are actually REQUIRED to send them.\n\nANSWER: E"

Extended addresses aren't specifically required or prohibited for GTS functionality.\n\n2. **Device capability**: Not all devices need guaranteed time slots. GTS is an optional feature that devices use when they need guaranteed bandwidth or latency guarantees.\n\n3. **Mandatory vs Optional**: The key word here is \"required.\" GTS Request commands are NOT mandatory for all devices. They are only sent when:\n   - A device actually needs a guaranteed time slot\n   - The device is capable of requesting GTS\n   - The device chooses to use this optional feature\n\n4.

          "explanation": "Let me think through this step by step.\n\nFirst, let me understand what we're dealing with:\n- This is about the Nmfaf_3daDataManagement service operation\n- Specifically the \"Deconfigure\" operation\n- MFAF appears to be a network function in 3GPP Release 18\n- The context is about data or analytics management\n\nNow let's analyze the key word: \"Deconfigure\"\n- \"Deconfigure\" generally means to remove or stop a configuration\n- This is the opposite of \"Configure\"\n- It implies undoing or stopping something that was previously set up\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA) \"To configure the MFAF to map data...\" - This uses \"configure\" which is contradictory to \"Deconfigure\" in the operation name. This seems incorrect.\n\nB) \"To configure the MFAF to stop mapping data...\" - This mentions stopping the mapping, which aligns with the \"Deconfigure\" concept. Even though it says \"configure,\" it's configuring the system TO STOP, which is essentially deconfiguring.\n\nC) \"To supply data or analytics...\" - This is about data delivery, not about configuration/deconfiguration. Doesn't match.\n\nD) \"To fetch data or analytics...\" - This is about data retrieval, not about configuration/deconfiguration. Doesn't match.\n\nThe Deconfigure operation would logically be used to reverse or stop what a Configure operation sets up. If Configure sets up the mapping of data/analytics to outbound notification endpoints, then Deconfigure would stop or remove those mappings.\n\nOption B is the most logical answer as it describes stopping the mapping functionality, which is what a deconfigure operation would do.\n\nANSWER: B",

          "explanation": "Let me think through this step by step.\n\nThe Alamouti scheme is a space-time block coding technique used in MIMO communications. To understand the diversity gain, I need to recall how the Alamouti scheme works.\n\n**Key features of the Alamouti scheme:**\n- It uses 2 transmit antennas\n- It transmits symbols over 2 time slots\n- The transmission matrix is:\n  - Time slot 1: Antenna 1 sends s₁, Antenna 2 sends s₂\n  - Time slot 2: Antenna 1 sends -s₂*, Antenna 2 sends s₁*\n\n**Diversity gain definition:**\nDiversity gain refers to the number of independent copies of the transmitted signal that are received. This is determined by the number of independent fading paths.\n\n**Calculating diversity gain for Alamouti scheme:**\n- With 2 transmit antennas and 1 receive antenna: The receiver gets 2 independent fading paths (one from each transmit antenna)\n- The Alamouti code is designed such that each symbol experiences diversity equal to the number of transmit antennas × number of receive antennas\n\nFor the basic Alamouti scheme with:\n- 2 transmit antennas\n- 1 receive antenna\n- Diversity gain = 2 × 1 = 2\n\nEach symbol is effectively transmitted through both antennas (due to the clever encoding), providing a diversity order of 2.\n\nThis means each symbol benefits from 2 independent fading paths, which significantly improves the reliability of detection compared to no diversity (which would be 1).\n\nANSWER: C",

          "explanation": "Let me think through this step by step regarding IEEE 802.15.4 GTS (Guaranteed Time Slot) requests.\n\nFirst, let me recall what GTS is in IEEE 802.15.4:\n- GTS is a feature that allows devices to request dedicated time slots for communication\n- It's part of the superframe structure in beacon-enabled networks\n- GTS allocation is managed by the PAN coordinator\n\nNow, let's consider when devices are REQUIRED to send GTS Request commands:\n\n1. **Addressing requirements**: GTS requests can be sent by devices with short addresses. Extended addresses aren't specifically required or prohibited for GTS functionality.\n\n2. **Device capability**: Not all devices need guaranteed time slots. GTS is an optional feature that devices use when they need guaranteed bandwidth or latency guarantees.\n\n3. **Mandatory vs Optional**: The key word here is \"required.\" GTS Request commands are NOT mandatory for all devices. They are only sent when:\n   - A device actually needs a guaranteed time slot\n   - The device is capable of requesting GTS\n   - The device chooses to use this optional feature\n\n4. Looking at the options:\n   - A) Incorrect - short addresses are actually used for GTS\n   - B) Incorrect - extended addressing is not a requirement\n   - C) This seems to be a tautology but may be hinting that only capable devices send them\n   - D) Incorrect - not all devices are required to send GTS requests\n   - E) This might be correct if we interpret \"required\" strictly - no devices are actually REQUIRED to send GTS requests; it's optional\n\nSince GTS is an optional feature and devices only send GTS Request commands when they choose to request a guaranteed time slot, no devices are actually REQUIRED to send them.\n\nANSWER: E",

          "explanation": "Let me think through this step by step.\n\nThis question is about 3GPP Release 17 specifications regarding how a supporting UE (User Equipment) reattaches to the same core network operator in a shared network scenario after being detached.\n\nKey considerations:\n\n1. **Shared Network Context**: In a shared network, multiple operators can share the same radio access network (RAN) infrastructure while maintaining separate core networks.\n\n2. **The Challenge**: When a UE detaches and then wants to reattach, it needs a mechanism to connect back to the same core network operator it was previously using.\n\n3. **Analyzing each option**:\n\n   **Option A**: Requesting the core network node to remember - This would require the network to maintain state information after detachment, which goes against the principle of detachment (releasing resources).\n\n   **Option B**: Using information stored in the UE when it was detached - This makes technical sense. When a UE detaches, it can store relevant information about which core network operator it was connected to. Upon reattachment, it can use this stored information to select the same operator.\n\n   **Option C**: Relying on SIM/USIM card - The SIM/USIM contains subscription information but doesn't necessarily track which specific core network operator was selected in a shared network during the previous session.\n\n   **Option D**: Fresh attach procedure - This would mean starting from scratch without any memory of the previous connection, which wouldn't guarantee attachment to the same operator.\n\nThe most logical approach is for the UE to store information locally during detachment and use it for reattachment.\n\nANSWER: B",
