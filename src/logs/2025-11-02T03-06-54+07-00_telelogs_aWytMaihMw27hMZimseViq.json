              "type": "reasoning",
              "reasoning": "We need identify reason for throughput dropping below 600Mbps in certain road sections. The drive test shows throughput at various timestamps. Notably at 10:25:34 to 10:25:36 it's low (~0.14-13Mbps). Later at 10:25:37 onward throughput high (>1000Mbps). The low throughput occurs at times 10:25:34,35,36. Check parameters. At those times, serving PCI is 919, but neighbor top1 PCI shows 737 etc. The mechanical tilt/digital tilt? For cell id 15 (PCI 919). The gNodeB parameters: cell 15 has digital tilt 9, digital azimuth 0, beam scenario SCENARIO_1 (vertical beamwidth 6 degrees). That beam scenario default (SCENARIO_1) uses 6 degrees vertical width.\n\nAlso we have the mention of downtilt default electronic 255 => 6 deg. Here we have Digital Tilt 9 degrees (maybe mechanical tilt 31). Wait mechanical azimuth 100, mechanical downtilt 31, digital tilt 9. So total downtilt maybe 40 deg? This may affect coverage.\n\nThe throughput drop occurs when speed maybe 34 km/h at 10:25:34 (point before drop). At 10:25:35 speed 28, at 10:25:36 speed 1 - but throughput still low. So speed not causing.\n\nWe need to pick one of root causes C1-C8. Let's analyze each:\n\nC1: Serving cell's downtilt angle too large causing weak coverage far end. If downtilt too high leads to weak coverage causing low SNR. The drive test shows at 10:25:34 SS-RSRP -85.48 dBm, SS-SINR 11.59 dB. At 10:25:36 throughput 13.23 Mbps, RSRP -87.19, SINR 8.41. These are weak, maybe due to downtilt causing coverage degrade, but later RSRP changes? At 10:25:37 throughput 146.52, RSRP -88.07, SINR 11.04. Actually lower RSRP but throughput higher. That is odd: at 10:25:39 throughput 1056 with RSRP -77.94, better coverage. So at earlier times maybe at distance.\n\nMaybe the coverage distance issue: cell's coverage distance exceeds 1km over-shooting causing issues near far end. But we examine the coordinates: The vehicle seems moving from 128.139682 to 128.139964 along latitude 32.623 etc. This is about maybe 200m. Likely within coverage.\n\nC3: Neighbor cell provides higher throughput. But throughput drop is while receiving low from server, might be due to neighbor providing better link? Could be C4: overlapping coverage from non-colocated cells causing interference. Let's analyze neighbor RSRP values: For timestamp 10:25:34, neighbor filtered Tx BRSRP top 1 -88.89 dBm, top 2 -100.49, top 3 -107.53. So neighbor 737 not as strong.\n\nAt 10:25:35, top 1 -86.71, top 2 -100.46, top3 -110.01. So similar.\n\nThroughput 0.14 at 10:25:35 despite moderate RSRP. Might be due to handovers? 10:25:34 still PCI 919, then switches to PCI 737 at 10:25:37. So a handover event occurs between 34 and 37. The drop could be due to hysteresis or failing to get good resources when handover. C5: Frequent handovers degrade performance. We saw a handover from PCI 919 to 737 between those timestamps. Did we see many? At 10:25:34-36 staying on 919. At 10:25:37 switches to 737; then stays 737 after. The drop is just before handover. The drop may be due to handover performance.\n\nC6: Same PCI mod30 interference: 919 mod30 = ? 919/30=30 *30=900 remainder 19. 737 mod30 = 30*24=720 remainder 17. Not equal.\n\nC7: Speed >40km/h impact throughput: speeds only up to 38 km/h.\n\nC8: Average scheduled RBs below 160. Let's check at low throughput timestamps: 10:25:34, 5G KPI PCell Layer1 DL RB Num is 161.0 >160. 10:25:35 RB 160.0 exactly 160. 10:25:36 RB 186. Good.\n\nSo not below 160.\n\nLet's consider downtilt again: The test shows poor coverage at beginning maybe due to mechanical downtilt 31 + digital 9 => 40 deg. Possibly too high causing coverage at far end lost? The vehicle may be near far end? But distance only ~200m. I think cause likely due to frequent handovers (C5). The throughput drop occurred just before a handover event. But we only see one handover. \"Frequent handovers degrade performance\" refers to frequent handovers not single. But maybe the route includes more handovers. In the data, we saw one. But the test scenario might include multiple road sections. The drop is in certain road sections, maybe where adjacent cells have same coverage causing handover. Could be interference (C4). Non-colocated co-frequency neighboring cells cause severity overlapping coverage. This could happen where neighbor cell's coverage overlaps with serving leading to interference. In data, neighbor cell top 2 filtered BRSRP -100 dBm is weak. But maybe the neighbor cells 36 & 430 etc. But these are small.\n\nC1 might fit: Serving cell's downtilt angle too large causing weak coverage at far end leading to low throughput. The beam scenario for cell 919 is SCENARIO_1, which uses 6-degree vertical beamwidth (narrow). But digital tilt 9 deg might be too large causing the beam narrow. But we need to evaluate if downtilt is too large: mechanical downtilt 31 deg + digital 9 deg = 40 deg, which is quite large. This could cause coverage drop at farther end causing low throughput. After handover to cell 737 with mechanical downtilt 6 and digital 0 and beam scenario DEFAULT (vertical beamwidth 6 deg). Those maybe more appropriate. Yet throughput after handover is high.\n\nBut the problem says throughput dropped below 600Mbps in certain road sections, not just before handover. Let's inspect data: from 10:25:34 to 10:25:36 throughput: 600.0, 0.14, 13.23. 600 at threshold. 10:25:35 drop below 600; at 10:25:36 still below. Then 10:25:37 >600. So the drop maybe due to cell being at far end of coverage at low SNR until better interference. This could be due to poor downtilt causing insufficient coverage at far end. So C1 plausible.\n\nC2: coverage distance exceeds 1km, resulting in over-shooting. Not sure.\n\nC4: overlapping coverage causing interference. We saw similar neighbor BRSRP not high; maybe overlapping? But not huge.\n\nWe need to choose most likely cause: Among options, C1 seems plausible: downtilt too large causing weak coverage at far end.\n\nLet's check engineering parameters: For cell 15 (PCI 919) mechanical downtilt 31 degrees; For cell 1 (PCI 737) mechanical downtilt 3 deg. The difference is huge. Could cause the issues. The test shows drop when on PCI 919. After handover to PCI 737, throughput improved. So cause = C1.\n\nTherefore output \\boxed{C1}.",

Notably at 10:25:34 to 10:25:36 it's low (~0.14-13Mbps). Later at 10:25:37 onward throughput high (>1000Mbps). The low throughput occurs at times 10:25:34,35,36. Check parameters. At those times, serving PCI is 919, but neighbor top1 PCI shows 737 etc. The mechanical tilt/digital tilt? For cell id 15 (PCI 919). The gNodeB parameters: cell 15 has digital tilt 9, digital azimuth 0, beam scenario SCENARIO_1 (vertical beamwidth 6 degrees). That beam scenario default (SCENARIO_1) uses 6 degrees vertical width.\n\nAlso we have the mention of downtilt default electronic 255 => 6 deg. Here we have Digital Tilt 9 degrees (maybe mechanical tilt 31). Wait mechanical azimuth 100, mechanical downtilt 31, digital tilt 9. So total downtilt maybe 40 deg? This may affect coverage.\n\nThe throughput drop occurs when speed maybe 34 km/h at 10:25:34 (point before drop). At 10:25:35 speed 28, at 10:25:36 speed 1 - but throughput still low. So speed not causing.\n\nWe need to pick one of root causes C1-C8. Let's analyze each:\n\nC1: Serving cell's downtilt angle too large causing weak coverage far end. If downtilt too high leads to weak coverage causing low SNR. The drive test shows at 10:25:34 SS-RSRP -85.48 dBm, SS-SINR 11.59 dB. At 10:25:36 throughput 13.23 Mbps, RSRP -87.19, SINR 8.41. These are weak, maybe due to downtilt causing coverage degrade, but later RSRP changes? At 10:25:37 throughput 146.52, RSRP -88.07, SINR 11.04. Actually lower RSRP but throughput higher. That is odd: at 10:25:39 throughput 1056 with RSRP -77.94, better coverage. So at earlier times maybe at distance.\n\nMaybe the coverage distance issue: cell's coverage distance exceeds 1km over-shooting causing issues near far end. But we examine the coordinates: The vehicle seems moving from 128.139682 to 128.139964 along latitude 32.623 etc. This is about maybe 200m. Likely within coverage.\n\nC3: Neighbor cell provides higher throughput. But throughput drop is while receiving low from server, might be due to neighbor providing better link? Could be C4: overlapping coverage from non-colocated cells causing interference. Let's analyze neighbor RSRP values: For timestamp 10:25:34, neighbor filtered Tx BRSRP top 1 -88.89 dBm, top 2 -100.49, top 3 -107.53. So neighbor 737 not as strong.\n\nAt 10:25:35, top 1 -86.71, top 2 -100.46, top3 -110.01. So similar.\n\nThroughput 0.14 at 10:25:35 despite moderate RSRP. Might be due to handovers? 10:25:34 still PCI 919, then switches to PCI 737 at 10:25:37. So a handover event occurs between 34 and 37. The drop could be due to hysteresis or failing to get good resources when handover. C5: Frequent handovers degrade performance. We saw a handover from PCI 919 to 737 between those timestamps. Did we see many? At 10:25:34-36 staying on 919. At 10:25:37 switches to 737; then stays 737 after. The drop is just before handover. The drop may be due to handover performance.\n\nC6: Same PCI mod30 interference: 919 mod30 = ? 919/30=30 *30=900 remainder 19. 737 mod30 = 30*24=720 remainder 17. Not equal.\n\nC7: Speed >40km/h impact throughput: speeds only up to 38 km/h.\n\nC8: Average scheduled RBs below 160.

Good.\n\nSo not below 160.\n\nLet's consider downtilt again: The test shows poor coverage at beginning maybe due to mechanical downtilt 31 + digital 9 => 40 deg. Possibly too high causing coverage at far end lost? The vehicle may be near far end? But distance only ~200m. I think cause likely due to frequent handovers (C5). The throughput drop occurred just before a handover event. But we only see one handover. \"Frequent handovers degrade performance\" refers to frequent handovers not single. But maybe the route includes more handovers. In the data, we saw one. But the test scenario might include multiple road sections. The drop is in certain road sections, maybe where adjacent cells have same coverage causing handover. Could be interference (C4). Non-colocated co-frequency neighboring cells cause severity overlapping coverage. This could happen where neighbor cell's coverage overlaps with serving leading to interference. In data, neighbor cell top 2 filtered BRSRP -100 dBm is weak. But maybe the neighbor cells 36 & 430 etc. But these are small.\n\nC1 might fit: Serving cell's downtilt angle too large causing weak coverage at far end leading to low throughput. The beam scenario for cell 919 is SCENARIO_1, which uses 6-degree vertical beamwidth (narrow). But digital tilt 9 deg might be too large causing the beam narrow. But we need to evaluate if downtilt is too large: mechanical downtilt 31 deg + digital 9 deg = 40 deg, which is quite large. This could cause coverage drop at farther end causing low throughput. After handover to cell 737 with mechanical downtilt 6 and digital 0 and beam scenario DEFAULT (vertical beamwidth 6 deg). Those maybe more appropriate. Yet throughput after handover is high.\n\nBut the problem says throughput dropped below 600Mbps in certain road sections, not just before handover. Let's inspect data: from 10:25:34 to 10:25:36 throughput: 600.0, 0.14, 13.23. 600 at threshold. 10:25:35 drop below 600; at 10:25:36 still below. Then 10:25:37 >600. So the drop maybe due to cell being at far end of coverage at low SNR until better interference. This could be due to poor downtilt causing insufficient coverage at far end. So C1 plausible.\n\nC2: coverage distance exceeds 1km, resulting in over-shooting. Not sure.\n\nC4: overlapping coverage causing interference. We saw similar neighbor BRSRP not high; maybe overlapping? But not huge.\n\nWe need to choose most likely cause: Among options, C1 seems plausible: downtilt too large causing weak coverage at far end.\n\nLet's check engineering parameters: For cell 15 (PCI 919) mechanical downtilt 31 degrees; For cell 1 (PCI 737) mechanical downtilt 3 deg. The difference is huge. Could cause the issues. The test shows drop when on PCI 919. After handover to PCI 737, throughput improved. So cause = C1.\n\nTherefore output \\boxed{C1}.",

But maybe the route includes more handovers. In the data, we saw one. But the test scenario might include multiple road sections. The drop is in certain road sections, maybe where adjacent cells have same coverage causing handover. Could be interference (C4). Non-colocated co-frequency neighboring cells cause severity overlapping coverage. This could happen where neighbor cell's coverage overlaps with serving leading to interference. In data, neighbor cell top 2 filtered BRSRP -100 dBm is weak. But maybe the neighbor cells 36 & 430 etc. But these are small.\n\nC1 might fit: Serving cell's downtilt angle too large causing weak coverage at far end leading to low throughput. The beam scenario for cell 919 is SCENARIO_1, which uses 6-degree vertical beamwidth (narrow). But digital tilt 9 deg might be too large causing the beam narrow. But we need to evaluate if downtilt is too large: mechanical downtilt 31 deg + digital 9 deg = 40 deg, which is quite large. This could cause coverage drop at farther end causing low throughput. After handover to cell 737 with mechanical downtilt 6 and digital 0 and beam scenario DEFAULT (vertical beamwidth 6 deg). Those maybe more appropriate. Yet throughput after handover is high.\n\nBut the problem says throughput dropped below 600Mbps in certain road sections, not just before handover. Let's inspect data: from 10:25:34 to 10:25:36 throughput: 600.0, 0.14, 13.23. 600 at threshold. 10:25:35 drop below 600; at 10:25:36 still below. Then 10:25:37 >600. So the drop maybe due to cell being at far end of coverage at low SNR until better interference. This could be due to poor downtilt causing insufficient coverage at far end. So C1 plausible.\n\nC2: coverage distance exceeds 1km, resulting in over-shooting. Not sure.\n\nC4: overlapping coverage causing interference. We saw similar neighbor BRSRP not high; maybe overlapping? But not huge.\n\nWe need to choose most likely cause: Among options, C1 seems plausible: downtilt too large causing weak coverage at far end.\n\nLet's check engineering parameters: For cell 15 (PCI 919) mechanical downtilt 31 degrees; For cell 1 (PCI 737) mechanical downtilt 3 deg. The difference is huge. Could cause the issues. The test shows drop when on PCI 919. After handover to PCI 737, throughput improved. So cause = C1.\n\nTherefore output \\boxed{C1}.\n</think>\n\\boxed{C1}"

                  "reasoning": "We need to analyze drive-test user plane throughput dropping below 600 Mbps in certain road sections. The data table shows throughput for many timestamps. Let's identify where throughput < 600. At 10:25:35 throughput 0.14, 10:25:36 13.23, 10:25:37 146.52. 8, 10:25:38 315.45. 10:25:39 1056.42, 10:25:40 1085.04 etc. So drops below 600 at 10:25:35, 10:25:36, 10:25:37? Actually 146, 13, 0.14. 10:25:38 315 still <600. 10:25:39 etc high. Also earlier at timestamp 10:25:34 throughput 600 exactly. So drop occurs when serving PCI changed? Let's analyze: first point timestamp 10:25:34: Serving PCI 919; throughput 600. Next at 10:25:35: Serving PCI 36; throughput 0.14. 10:25:36 Serving PCI 36; throughput 13.23. 10:25:37 Serving PCI 36; throughput 146.52. 10:25:38 Serving PCI 36; throughput 315.45. 10:25:39: Serving PCI 737; throughput 1056.42. 10:25:40: Serving PCI 737; throughput 1085.04. So drop occurs when handover to PCI 36 (serving cell 36) leads to low throughput. So potential root cause: Maybe neighbor cell and serving cell same PCI mod 30 causing interference? Let's see PCI values: serving 36, neighbor 737 perhaps? No neighbor top sets. With serving 36, neighbor top 1 PCI 737. That is 937? Actually 737. 36 mod 30 = 6. 737 mod 30 = 7? 737 /30 = 24 remainder 17? Actually 30*24 = 720, remainder 17. So not same. However, potential root cause C6: neighbor cell and serving cell have same PCI mod 30 causing interference. Might affect when serving = 36, neighbor maybe 66? Not. Data shows neighbor cells: For timestamp 10:25:35, neighbor top 1 PCI is 737, neighbor top 2 PCI 919?? Actually check row: timestamp 10:25:35: Serving PCI 36, neighbor 737; top2 919; top3 430. So neighbor serving 919? But that is a high PCI. Not same mod 30 perhaps. 919 mod30 = 919-30*30=919-900=19. 36 mod30=6; not same. So not cause C6.\n\nC5 Frequent handovers degrade performance. Indeed there's a handover from PCI 919 to 36 to 36 continues until change to 737. Throughput low during that period. That could be cause. However the drop from 600 to 0 near speed 28 km/h; not high.\n\nC4 Non-colocated co-frequency neighboring cells cause severe overlapping coverage. Maybe? But no colocated config.\n\nC2 coverage distance exceeds 1km resulting in over-shooting. But cells appear at same location maybe.\n\nC1: serv cell downtilt too large causing weak coverage at far end. Not relevant.\n\nC7 test vehicle speed exceeds 40km/h impacting throughput. Highest speed observed 38. Not far.\n\nC8 average scheduled RBs below 160 affecting throughput. Let's examine RB numbers: they vary 161, 160, 186, 180, etc. Not below 160 during low throughput? For timestamp 10:25:35 RB 160. 10:25:36 RB 186. 10:25:38 RB173. 10:25:39 168. So average scheduled RB not below 160 until 160 exactly. That's not too low.\n\nBut perhaps root cause is C3 A neighboring cell provides higher throughput. Not drop, but high throughput after rehandover.\n\nC5 Frequent handovers degrade performance. The drop aligns with handover from cell 919 (high throughput) to 36. So cause likely C5.\n\nLook at data: initial high throughput at serving PCI 919, neighbor 737 etc. Then handover to 36, low throughput. The reason might be due to poor neighbor cell connection due to digital tilt/downtilt difference etc. But which root cause best match?\n\nLet's examine the engineering parameters. Which cell serving 36? We need to find cell with PCI 36. Engineering data: cell ID 16 has PCI 36. That cell's parameters: Longitud, lat 128.173481, 32.619178. Mechanical azimuth 20, mechanical downtilt 10, digital tilt 255, digital azimuth 0, Beam scenario DEFAULT (vertical beam width 6). Height 90m, 64T64R.\n\nThe vehicle was near 128.1398, close location (~300m). So maybe not covering.\n\nThus low throughput due to being served by a cell far away perhaps. But root cause C2 coverage distance >1km leads to overshooting. But here distance maybe 2.5km? Let's approximate. The cell at 128.1735,32.619: difference to vehicle at 128.1398 long approx 0.0337 degrees ~ 3.3 km in east-west? Each deg approx 111 km / cos(lat). At 32.6 lat, cos~0.84, so each deg ~93km. 0.0337*93=3.14 km. lat difference ~0.0033 deg ~300m. So distance ~3.2 km. So yes >1km. So the vehicle might be far from serving cell, causing low throughput; later rehandovers to closer cells (737, 919) yield high throughput.\n\nThus C2 (coverage distance exceeds 1km, resulting in over-shooting) seems plausible.\n\nBut which root cause is most likely? The data shows drop only when serving cell PCI 36 is far away. That suggests coverage distance overshoot.\n\nThus I think answer: C2. Let's make final answer accordingly.\n\n",

        "94ac0e0012afed9c593c3f78276f7918": "We need to analyze drive-test user plane throughput dropping below 600 Mbps in certain road sections. The data table shows throughput for many timestamps. Let's identify where throughput < 600. At 10:25:35 throughput 0.14, 10:25:36 13.23, 10:25:37 146.52. 8, 10:25:38 315.45. 10:25:39 1056.42, 10:25:40 1085.04 etc. So drops below 600 at 10:25:35, 10:25:36, 10:25:37? Actually 146, 13, 0.14. 10:25:38 315 still <600. 10:25:39 etc high. Also earlier at timestamp 10:25:34 throughput 600 exactly. So drop occurs when serving PCI changed? Let's analyze: first point timestamp 10:25:34: Serving PCI 919; throughput 600. Next at 10:25:35: Serving PCI 36; throughput 0.14. 10:25:36 Serving PCI 36; throughput 13.23. 10:25:37 Serving PCI 36; throughput 146.52. 10:25:38 Serving PCI 36; throughput 315.45. 10:25:39: Serving PCI 737; throughput 1056.42. 10:25:40: Serving PCI 737; throughput 1085.04. So drop occurs when handover to PCI 36 (serving cell 36) leads to low throughput. So potential root cause: Maybe neighbor cell and serving cell same PCI mod 30 causing interference? Let's see PCI values: serving 36, neighbor 737 perhaps? No neighbor top sets. With serving 36, neighbor top 1 PCI 737. That is 937? Actually 737. 36 mod 30 = 6. 737 mod 30 = 7? 737 /30 = 24 remainder 17? Actually 30*24 = 720, remainder 17. So not same. However, potential root cause C6: neighbor cell and serving cell have same PCI mod 30 causing interference. Might affect when serving = 36, neighbor maybe 66? Not. Data shows neighbor cells: For timestamp 10:25:35, neighbor top 1 PCI is 737, neighbor top 2 PCI 919?? Actually check row: timestamp 10:25:35: Serving PCI 36, neighbor 737; top2 919; top3 430. So neighbor serving 919? But that is a high PCI. Not same mod 30 perhaps. 919 mod30 = 919-30*30=919-900=19. 36 mod30=6; not same. So not cause C6.\n\nC5 Frequent handovers degrade performance. Indeed there's a handover from PCI 919 to 36 to 36 continues until change to 737. Throughput low during that period. That could be cause. However the drop from 600 to 0 near speed 28 km/h; not high.\n\nC4 Non-colocated co-frequency neighboring cells cause severe overlapping coverage. Maybe? But no colocated config.\n\nC2 coverage distance exceeds 1km resulting in over-shooting. But cells appear at same location maybe.\n\nC1: serv cell downtilt too large causing weak coverage at far end. Not relevant.\n\nC7 test vehicle speed exceeds 40km/h impacting throughput. Highest speed observed 38. Not far.\n\nC8 average scheduled RBs below 160 affecting throughput. Let's examine RB numbers: they vary 161, 160, 186, 180, etc. Not below 160 during low throughput? For timestamp 10:25:35 RB 160. 10:25:36 RB 186. 10:25:38 RB173. 10:25:39 168. So average scheduled RB not below 160 until 160 exactly. That's not too low.\n\nBut perhaps root cause is C3 A neighboring cell provides higher throughput. Not drop, but high throughput after rehandover.\n\nC5 Frequent handovers degrade performance. The drop aligns with handover from cell 919 (high throughput) to 36. So cause likely C5.\n\nLook at data: initial high throughput at serving PCI 919, neighbor 737 etc. Then handover to 36, low throughput. The reason might be due to poor neighbor cell connection due to digital tilt/downtilt difference etc. But which root cause best match?\n\nLet's examine the engineering parameters. Which cell serving 36? We need to find cell with PCI 36. Engineering data: cell ID 16 has PCI 36. That cell's parameters: Longitud, lat 128.173481, 32.619178. Mechanical azimuth 20, mechanical downtilt 10, digital tilt 255, digital azimuth 0, Beam scenario DEFAULT (vertical beam width 6). Height 90m, 64T64R.\n\nThe vehicle was near 128.1398, close location (~300m). So maybe not covering.\n\nThus low throughput due to being served by a cell far away perhaps. But root cause C2 coverage distance >1km leads to overshooting. But here distance maybe 2.5km? Let's approximate. The cell at 128.1735,32.619: difference to vehicle at 128.1398 long approx 0.0337 degrees ~ 3.3 km in east-west? Each deg approx 111 km / cos(lat). At 32.6 lat, cos~0.84, so each deg ~93km. 0.0337*93=3.14 km. lat difference ~0.0033 deg ~300m. So distance ~3.2 km. So yes >1km. So the vehicle might be far from serving cell, causing low throughput; later rehandovers to closer cells (737, 919) yield high throughput.\n\nThus C2 (coverage distance exceeds 1km, resulting in over-shooting) seems plausible.\n\nBut which root cause is most likely? The data shows drop only when serving cell PCI 36 is far away. That suggests coverage distance overshoot.\n\nThus I think answer: C2. Let's make final answer accordingly.\n\n"

              "reasoning": "The problem: identify reason for throughput dropping below 600Mbps in certain road sections. We have 5G drive test and engineering parameters. We need to pick the most likely root cause from C1-C8.\n\nWe need to analyze the data: For timestamps where throughput < 600 Mbps. There's 600.0 at 10:25:34, but then 0.14 at 10:25:35, 13.23 at 10:25:36. 346.52 at 10:25:37, 515.45 at 10:25:38, 1056.42 at 10:25:39, 1085.04 at 10:25:40, 1102.15 at 10:25:41, 1091.58 at 10:25:42, 1010.69 at 10:25:43. So throughput dips at 10:25:35 and 10:25:36. Speeds: 28km/h, 1km/h. Vehicle speed: 28 and 1. Only at those points throughput low. At 10:25:34 speed 34, throughput 600. So throughput dropping below 600 happens when Speed low? Actually at 1 km/h throughput 13.23. 28 km/h throughput 0.14. That is weird low. At 38 km/h it was 346.52, still below 600 but improves at 32 km/h (515), still below, but then improved.\n\nWe also see serving PCI is 919 at 10:25:34, 25 for 0.14? Wait check: table: 5G KPI PCell RF Serving PCI: For 10:25:35: 919? Let's verify row: data row: \"2025-05-07 10:25:35.000000|128.139717|32.622993|28|919|-78.15|8.5|0.14..\". So serving PCI 919. At 10:25:36 also serving PCI 919. At 10:25:34 serving PCI 919. At 10:25:37 serving PCI 737? Actually row: timestamp 10:25:37 has 737. So at that time we switched serving cells to 737. Over this small segment, the vehicle moves between cells.\n\nThe throughput drop could be due to handover or cell switching. The root causes include handovers, downtilt, coverage distance etc.\n\nCheck mechanical downtilt for cells: Cell ID 26 (PCI 291) default, not used. Cell ID 15 (PCI 919) SCENARIO_1, digital tilt 8, beam scenario SCENARIO_1: vertical beamwidth 6 degrees. Beam scenario for cell 15 is SCENARIO_1 => 6 deg beamwidth. The digital downtilt 8 degrees; mechanical downtilt 4.\n\nThe mechanical downtilt 4 deg: but digital tilt 8 degrees; digital tilt is 8 deg? Actually digital tilt is 8. So tilt? The default electronic downtilt value 255 representing 6 deg.\n\nAlso beam scenario SCENARIO_1: vertical beamwidth 6 deg.\n\nSo we have a small beamwidth, not problematic.\n\nHowever throughputs: The vehicle at 28 km/h on cell 919 had low throughput 0.14. That indicates maybe poor link due to interference? Let's look at the neighbor cells: The top neighbor PCIs: 737, 36, 430 at that time.\n\nFor 919 cell, neighbor PCI 737 has filtered Tx BRSRP -81.71 dBm. Slight better. Others -95.46 etc.\n\nNow, the neighbor cell 737 is using digital azimuth 5 deg? Wait mechanical azimuth 45, mechanical downtilt 3, digital tilt 7, digital azimuth 5, beam scenario SCENARIO_7. Beam width 12 degrees. So coverage maybe.\n\nPotential root cause: Non-colocated co-frequency neighboring cells causing severe overlapping coverage (C4). Are there co-frequency neighbors? 919 and 737 may be colocation? Possibly.\n\nAlso, same PCI mod 30 causing interference (C6). 919 mod 30 = 1 (919 % 30 = 1). 737 % 30 = 7 (or 7?). 737 mod 30 = 7. So not same.\n\nC5 Frequent handovers degrade performance. We see at 10:25:34 to 10:25:35 there was handover? Actually at 10:25:34 serving PCI 919, at 10:25:35 still 919. The drop didn't involve handover. But at 10:25:37 served by 737. The throughput low may be due to handover. But the low throughput occurred at times 10:25:35 and 10:25:36 before handover. No handover yet. So maybe due to cell-specific issue.\n\nC2: Serving coverage distance >1km. The vehicle near 128.139682, 32.623035. The gNodeB location is 128.139529, 32.623035, same location. So near. So not distance > 1km.\n\nC1: Down tilt too large causing weak coverage at far end. The mechanical downtilt values: for cell 15: 4 deg. Digital tilt 8 deg. 6. But what is the actual downtilt? In description: default electronic downtilt 255 representing 6 degrees. Other values represent actual downtilt angle in degrees. So digital tilt is 8 degrees actual tilt. mechanical downtilt 4 degrees. So combined? The electronic downtilt default 255 not specified. Actually gNodeB parameters list 'Digital Tilt' as 8. So maybe tilt is 8 deg. I think not too large.\n\nC3: A neighboring cell provides higher throughput. Not applicable.\n\nC7: Vehicle speed >40km/h, but speeds only <= 38.\n\nC8: Average scheduled RBs below 160, affecting throughput. What is the RB scheduling? It's 5G KPIs line: '5G KPI PCell Layer1 DL RB Num (Including 0)' column. At times of low throughput: 10:25:35 RB=160; 10:25:36 RB=186; 10:25:34 RB=161. So at 10:25:35 RB 160 exactly at threshold? Average scheduled RBs below 160 maybe cause low throughput. But at 10:25:35 RBC 160 equals threshold. 0.14 throughput. So maybe not.\n\nC4: Non-colocated co-frequency neighboring cells cause severe overlapping coverage. Possibly 919 and 737 are co-frequency? Not given.\n\nAlternatively, the cause might be due to digital tilt vs beam scenario causing mismatch causing coverage weak at edges. The measurement of SS-RSRP at 10:25:36 is -82.19. Not too bad. SINR 8.41, not low. Throughput only 13 Mbps.\n\nBut at 10:25:35 SS-RSRP -78.15, SINR 8.5 but throughput 0.14; This is due to scheduling?\n\nCheck neighbor cell BRSRP values: -81.71, -95.46, -105 for neighbor 1, 2, 3. So there is interference but not huge.\n\nAlso the scheduled RB number is 160; at 10:25:35 RB 160 might saturate but still low throughput. Might be due to RRC cell parameter?\n\nMaybe the cause is same PCI mod 30 causing interference: 919 mod 30 = 1; 737 mod 30 = 7. Not same.\n\nLet's search for the 5G KPIs: Perhaps the throughput dip due to \"Serving cell RSRP to neighbor ratio\" etc. But root cause list limited.\n\nWhich root cause best fits?\n\nWe saw that throughput low 0-13 at ~1 km/h speed but at 28 km/h also low (0.14). At 1 km/h we still see 13 Mbps, maybe due to heavy interference? Actually RSRP at 1 km/h is -82.19, SINR 8.41. Throughput 13Mbps. For -78.15 RSRP, SINR 8.5, throughput 0.14.\n\nSo RSRP improved but throughput low. Might be due to interference? But BRSRP neighbor -81.71.\n\nBut why neighbor's BRSRP -81 dBm? Similar to own RSRP magnitude. Could cause interference.\n\nAlso at 10:25:35 average scheduled RB 160. At 10:25:36 average scheduled RB 186 > 160. So throughput increase from 0.14 to 13.23.\n\nMaybe the root cause is \"Average scheduled RBs below 160\" but here average RBs are 160 or above. So not that.\n\nBut maybe in other road sections where throughput dropped below 600, average RBs were below 160. But we only have sample.\n\nAlso check beam scenario difference: cell 919 uses SCENARIO_1 with 6° beam width. That might be too narrow affecting some directions. If vehicle passes far from main lobe, throughput drop. The downtilt maybe small 4 degree.\n\nThe mechanical azimuth 100 deg, digital azimuth 0 deg? For cell 919, Mechanical Azimuth 100 deg (?). Actually gNodeB table shows for Cell ID 15 (PCI 919): Mechanical Azimuth 100, Mechanical Downtilt 4, Digital Tilt 8, Digital",

                  "reasoning": "We need to produce final answer boxed with best root cause. Need to choose one of C1-C8.\n\nWe should evaluate which root cause is most likely given data.\n\nLet's analyze each:\n\nC1: Downtilt angle too large causing weak coverage at far end. Down tilt for cell 919 is 4 + digital tilt 8. Down tilt might not be too large; 8 degrees not too large; typical values 12-15 deg. So not likely.\n\nC2: Coverage distance >1 km, causing overshoot. The data indicates vehicle is within 0.1 km from location (longitude difference ~0.0001). Not >1 km. So not.\n\nC3: A neighboring cell provides higher throughput. Not explanation.\n\nC4: Non-colocated co-frequency neighboring cells cause severe overlapping coverage. We don't know co-frequency. But 919 and 737 might be co-frequency. They are in different gNodeB ID? Cell IDs: cell 15 (PC 919) belongs to gNodeB 0000258. Cell 7 (PC 737) belong to same gNodeB 0000258. So they are co-located as same gNodeB. They may be co-frequency and non-colocated? They are same gNodeB, but not colocated? They are at same physical site? In engineering params: Cell 15 long lat: 128.139529,32.623042; Cell 7 long lat: 128.139529,32.623035. Very close. So colocated. So C4 not.\n\nAlternatively, neighbors across different gNodeB id 0000570 etc. But the data shows neighbor cells 36,430. These are other gNodeBs. But likely they are different frequency bands? We don't know.\n\nC5 Frequent handovers degrade performance. The measurement shows a handover between 919 and 737 around 10:25:37. Throughput before handover 0.14 and 13 at 918 919; after handover high throughput 346-1102. So handover itself not causing low throughput; actually high throughput after.\n\nC6 Same PCI mod 30 leads to interference. 919%30=1, 737%30=7; no conflict. So not.\n\nC7 Speed >40 km/h affecting throughput. Speeds 34, 28, 1, 38, 32, 0... So not >40. Speeds not correlated with throughput drop.\n\nC8 Average scheduled RBs below 160 affecting throughput. For low throughput entries, RB = 160 (at 28 km/h), 186 (1 km/h). Not really below 160. But maybe threshold lower. But at 34 km/h throughput 600, RB 161. That is above threshold.\n\nSo maybe the real cause: the measurement shows throughput <600 when RBs below 160? Wait at 34 km/h throughput 600, RB 161. At 28 km/h throughput 0.14, RB 160. So difference only 1 RB scheduled difference results in huge throughput change indicates RBs may be limiting throughput.\n\nIf throughput drops below 600 when RB scheduled is at or below 160? 160 scheduled at 0.14 throughput. So threshold maybe 160 vs 600? Data suggests throughput below 600 when scheduled RB <160? But 160 exactly not above. Actually, RB 160 at 0.14 throughput, obviously indicates maybe 160 RB is low scheduled due to interference or channel quality. So root cause could be low scheduled RB due to interference and scheduling decisions. But the root cause list indicates C8: Average scheduled RBs below 160, affecting throughput. This seems plausible.\n\nCheck at 10:25:35: RB 160 -> throughput 0.14. So extremely low RB leads to low throughput. At 10:25:36 RB 186 -> throughput 13.23, still low though RB >160, but throughput still low maybe due to poor channel? But at 10:25:34 RB 161 -> throughput 600. So high throughput. So maybe when RB count falls below 161 threshold, throughput drop drastically. So C8 best.\n\nThus answer: C8. So output: \\boxed{C8}\n\nBut the request: enclose its number in \\boxed{{}}. Actually says \"enclose its number in \\boxed{{}}\". Means e.g., \\boxed{C8}? or \\boxed{8}? It says \"box its number\". Likely \\boxed{C8}. But might need double braces? The format: \\boxed{{}} meaning inside braces. They write \\boxed{{}}? Eg: \\boxed{C8}. We'll output \\boxed{C8}.\n\nThus final call.\n\n",

We need to pick the most likely root cause from C1-C8.\n\nWe need to analyze the data: For timestamps where throughput < 600 Mbps. There's 600.0 at 10:25:34, but then 0.14 at 10:25:35, 13.23 at 10:25:36. 346.52 at 10:25:37, 515.45 at 10:25:38, 1056.42 at 10:25:39, 1085.04 at 10:25:40, 1102.15 at 10:25:41, 1091.58 at 10:25:42, 1010.69 at 10:25:43. So throughput dips at 10:25:35 and 10:25:36. Speeds: 28km/h, 1km/h. Vehicle speed: 28 and 1. Only at those points throughput low. At 10:25:34 speed 34, throughput 600. So throughput dropping below 600 happens when Speed low? Actually at 1 km/h throughput 13.23. 28 km/h throughput 0.14. That is weird low. At 38 km/h it was 346.52, still below 600 but improves at 32 km/h (515), still below, but then improved.\n\nWe also see serving PCI is 919 at 10:25:34, 25 for 0.14? Wait check: table: 5G KPI PCell RF Serving PCI: For 10:25:35: 919? Let's verify row: data row: \"2025-05-07 10:25:35.000000|128.139717|32.622993|28|919|-78.15|8.5|0.14..\". So serving PCI 919. At 10:25:36 also serving PCI 919. At 10:25:34 serving PCI 919. At 10:25:37 serving PCI 737? Actually row: timestamp 10:25:37 has 737. So at that time we switched serving cells to 737. Over this small segment, the vehicle moves between cells.\n\nThe throughput drop could be due to handover or cell switching. The root causes include handovers, downtilt, coverage distance etc.\n\nCheck mechanical downtilt for cells: Cell ID 26 (PCI 291) default, not used. Cell ID 15 (PCI 919) SCENARIO_1, digital tilt 8, beam scenario SCENARIO_1: vertical beamwidth 6 degrees. Beam scenario for cell 15 is SCENARIO_1 => 6 deg beamwidth. The digital downtilt 8 degrees; mechanical downtilt 4.\n\nThe mechanical downtilt 4 deg: but digital tilt 8 degrees; digital tilt is 8 deg? Actually digital tilt is 8. So tilt? The default electronic downtilt value 255 representing 6 deg.\n\nAlso beam scenario SCENARIO_1: vertical beamwidth 6 deg.\n\nSo we have a small beamwidth, not problematic.\n\nHowever throughputs: The vehicle at 28 km/h on cell 919 had low throughput 0.14. That indicates maybe poor link due to interference? Let's look at the neighbor cells: The top neighbor PCIs: 737, 36, 430 at that time.\n\nFor 919 cell, neighbor PCI 737 has filtered Tx BRSRP -81.71 dBm. Slight better. Others -95.46 etc.\n\nNow, the neighbor cell 737 is using digital azimuth 5 deg? Wait mechanical azimuth 45, mechanical downtilt 3, digital tilt 7, digital azimuth 5, beam scenario SCENARIO_7. Beam width 12 degrees. So coverage maybe.\n\nPotential root cause: Non-colocated co-frequency neighboring cells causing severe overlapping coverage (C4). Are there co-frequency neighbors? 919 and 737 may be colocation? Possibly.\n\nAlso, same PCI mod 30 causing interference (C6). 919 mod 30 = 1 (919 % 30 = 1). 737 % 30 = 7 (or 7?). 737 mod 30 = 7. So not same.\n\nC5 Frequent handovers degrade performance. We see at 10:25:34 to 10:25:35 there was handover? Actually at 10:25:34 serving PCI 919, at 10:25:35 still 919. The drop didn't involve handover. But at 10:25:37 served by 737. The throughput low may be due to handover. But the low throughput occurred at times 10:25:35 and 10:25:36 before handover. No handover yet. So maybe due to cell-specific issue.\n\nC2: Serving coverage distance >1km. The vehicle near 128.139682, 32.623035. The gNodeB location is 128.139529, 32.623035, same location. So near. So not distance > 1km.\n\nC1: Down tilt too large causing weak coverage at far end. The mechanical downtilt values: for cell 15: 4 deg. Digital tilt 8 deg. 6. But what is the actual downtilt? In description: default electronic downtilt 255 representing 6 degrees. Other values represent actual downtilt angle in degrees. So digital tilt is 8 degrees actual tilt. mechanical downtilt 4 degrees. So combined? The electronic downtilt default 255 not specified. Actually gNodeB parameters list 'Digital Tilt' as 8. So maybe tilt is 8 deg. I think not too large.\n\nC3: A neighboring cell provides higher throughput. Not applicable.\n\nC7: Vehicle speed >40km/h, but speeds only <= 38.\n\nC8: Average scheduled RBs below 160, affecting throughput. What is the RB scheduling? It's 5G KPIs line: '5G KPI PCell Layer1 DL RB Num (Including 0)' column. At times of low throughput: 10:25:35 RB=160; 10:25:36 RB=186; 10:25:34 RB=161. So at 10:25:35 RB 160 exactly at threshold? Average scheduled RBs below 160 maybe cause low throughput. But at 10:25:35 RBC 160 equals threshold. 0.14 throughput. So maybe not.\n\nC4: Non-colocated co-frequency neighboring cells cause severe overlapping coverage. Possibly 919 and 737 are co-frequency? Not given.\n\nAlternatively, the cause might be due to digital tilt vs beam scenario causing mismatch causing coverage weak at edges. The measurement of SS-RSRP at 10:25:36 is -82.19. Not too bad. SINR 8.41, not low. Throughput only 13 Mbps.\n\nBut at 10:25:35 SS-RSRP -78.15, SINR 8.5 but throughput 0.14; This is due to scheduling?\n\nCheck neighbor cell BRSRP values: -81.71, -95.46, -105 for neighbor 1, 2, 3. So there is interference but not huge.\n\nAlso the scheduled RB number is 160; at 10:25:35 RB 160 might saturate but still low throughput. Might be due to RRC cell parameter?\n\nMaybe the cause is same PCI mod 30 causing interference: 919 mod 30 = 1; 737 mod 30 = 7. Not same.\n\nLet's search for the 5G KPIs: Perhaps the throughput dip due to \"Serving cell RSRP to neighbor ratio\" etc. But root cause list limited.\n\nWhich root cause best fits?\n\nWe saw that throughput low 0-13 at ~1 km/h speed but at 28 km/h also low (0.14). At 1 km/h we still see 13 Mbps, maybe due to heavy interference? Actually RSRP at 1 km/h is -82.19, SINR 8.41. Throughput 13Mbps. For -78.15 RSRP, SINR 8.5, throughput 0.14.\n\nSo RSRP improved but throughput low. Might be due to interference? But BRSRP neighbor -81.71.\n\nBut why neighbor's BRSRP -81 dBm? Similar to own RSRP magnitude. Could cause interference.\n\nAlso at 10:25:35 average scheduled RB 160. At 10:25:36 average scheduled RB 186 > 160. So throughput increase from 0.14 to 13.23.\n\nMaybe the root cause is \"Average scheduled RBs below 160\" but here average RBs are 160 or above. So not that.\n\nBut maybe in other road sections where throughput dropped below 600, average RBs were below 160. But we only have sample.\n\nAlso check beam scenario difference: cell 919 uses SCENARIO_1 with 6° beam width. That might be too narrow affecting some directions. If vehicle passes far from main lobe, throughput drop. The downtilt maybe small 4 degree.\n\nThe mechanical azimuth 100 deg, digital azimuth 0 deg? For cell 919, Mechanical Azimuth 100 deg (?). Actually gNodeB table shows for Cell ID 15 (PCI 919): Mechanical Azimuth 100, Mechanical Downtilt 4, Digital Tilt 8, Digital",

They may be co-frequency and non-colocated? They are same gNodeB, but not colocated? They are at same physical site? In engineering params: Cell 15 long lat: 128.139529,32.623042; Cell 7 long lat: 128.139529,32.623035. Very close. So colocated. So C4 not.\n\nAlternatively, neighbors across different gNodeB id 0000570 etc. But the data shows neighbor cells 36,430. These are other gNodeBs. But likely they are different frequency bands? We don't know.\n\nC5 Frequent handovers degrade performance. The measurement shows a handover between 919 and 737 around 10:25:37. Throughput before handover 0.14 and 13 at 918 919; after handover high throughput 346-1102. So handover itself not causing low throughput; actually high throughput after.\n\nC6 Same PCI mod 30 leads to interference. 919%30=1, 737%30=7; no conflict. So not.\n\nC7 Speed >40 km/h affecting throughput. Speeds 34, 28, 1, 38, 32, 0... So not >40. Speeds not correlated with throughput drop.\n\nC8 Average scheduled RBs below 160 affecting throughput. For low throughput entries, RB = 160 (at 28 km/h), 186 (1 km/h). Not really below 160. But maybe threshold lower. But at 34 km/h throughput 600, RB 161. That is above threshold.\n\nSo maybe the real cause: the measurement shows throughput <600 when RBs below 160? Wait at 34 km/h throughput 600, RB 161. At 28 km/h throughput 0.14, RB 160. So difference only 1 RB scheduled difference results in huge throughput change indicates RBs may be limiting throughput.\n\nIf throughput drops below 600 when RB scheduled is at or below 160? 160 scheduled at 0.14 throughput. So threshold maybe 160 vs 600? Data suggests throughput below 600 when scheduled RB <160? But 160 exactly not above. Actually, RB 160 at 0.14 throughput, obviously indicates maybe 160 RB is low scheduled due to interference or channel quality. So root cause could be low scheduled RB due to interference and scheduling decisions. But the root cause list indicates C8: Average scheduled RBs below 160, affecting throughput. This seems plausible.\n\nCheck at 10:25:35: RB 160 -> throughput 0.14. So extremely low RB leads to low throughput. At 10:25:36 RB 186 -> throughput 13.23, still low though RB >160, but throughput still low maybe due to poor channel? But at 10:25:34 RB 161 -> throughput 600. So high throughput. So maybe when RB count falls below 161 threshold, throughput drop drastically. So C8 best.\n\nThus answer: C8. So output: \\boxed{C8}\n\nBut the request: enclose its number in \\boxed{{}}. Actually says \"enclose its number in \\boxed{{}}\". Means e.g., \\boxed{C8}? or \\boxed{8}? It says \"box its number\". Likely \\boxed{C8}. But might need double braces? The format: \\boxed{{}} meaning inside braces. They write \\boxed{{}}? Eg: \\boxed{C8}. We'll output \\boxed{C8}.\n\nThus final call.\n\n",
        "44fa8865819393b9db8deca45d41862d": "\n<think>\nThe problem: identify reason for throughput dropping below 600Mbps in certain road sections. We have 5G drive test and engineering parameters. We need to pick the most likely root cause from C1-C8.\n\nWe need to analyze the data: For timestamps where throughput < 600 Mbps. There's 600.0 at 10:25:34, but then 0.14 at 10:25:35, 13.23 at 10:25:36. 346.52 at 10:25:37, 515.45 at 10:25:38, 1056.42 at 10:25:39, 1085.04 at 10:25:40, 1102.15 at 10:25:41, 1091.58 at 10:25:42, 1010.69 at 10:25:43. So throughput dips at 10:25:35 and 10:25:36. Speeds: 28km/h, 1km/h. Vehicle speed: 28 and 1. Only at those points throughput low. At 10:25:34 speed 34, throughput 600. So throughput dropping below 600 happens when Speed low? Actually at 1 km/h throughput 13.23. 28 km/h throughput 0.14. That is weird low. At 38 km/h it was 346.52, still below 600 but improves at 32 km/h (515), still below, but then improved.\n\nWe also see serving PCI is 919 at 10:25:34, 25 for 0.14? Wait check: table: 5G KPI PCell RF Serving PCI: For 10:25:35: 919? Let's verify row: data row: \"2025-05-07 10:25:35.000000|128.139717|32.622993|28|919|-78.15|8.5|0.14..\". So serving PCI 919. At 10:25:36 also serving PCI 919. At 10:25:34 serving PCI 919. At 10:25:37 serving PCI 737? Actually row: timestamp 10:25:37 has 737. So at that time we switched serving cells to 737. Over this small segment, the vehicle moves between cells.\n\nThe throughput drop could be due to handover or cell switching. The root causes include handovers, downtilt, coverage distance etc.\n\nCheck mechanical downtilt for cells: Cell ID 26 (PCI 291) default, not used. Cell ID 15 (PCI 919) SCENARIO_1, digital tilt 8, beam scenario SCENARIO_1: vertical beamwidth 6 degrees. Beam scenario for cell 15 is SCENARIO_1 => 6 deg beamwidth. The digital downtilt 8 degrees; mechanical downtilt 4.\n\nThe mechanical downtilt 4 deg: but digital tilt 8 degrees; digital tilt is 8 deg? Actually digital tilt is 8. So tilt? The default electronic downtilt value 255 representing 6 deg.\n\nAlso beam scenario SCENARIO_1: vertical beamwidth 6 deg.\n\nSo we have a small beamwidth, not problematic.\n\nHowever throughputs: The vehicle at 28 km/h on cell 919 had low throughput 0.14. That indicates maybe poor link due to interference? Let's look at the neighbor cells: The top neighbor PCIs: 737, 36, 430 at that time.\n\nFor 919 cell, neighbor PCI 737 has filtered Tx BRSRP -81.71 dBm. Slight better. Others -95.46 etc.\n\nNow, the neighbor cell 737 is using digital azimuth 5 deg? Wait mechanical azimuth 45, mechanical downtilt 3, digital tilt 7, digital azimuth 5, beam scenario SCENARIO_7. Beam width 12 degrees. So coverage maybe.\n\nPotential root cause: Non-colocated co-frequency neighboring cells causing severe overlapping coverage (C4). Are there co-frequency neighbors? 919 and 737 may be colocation? Possibly.\n\nAlso, same PCI mod 30 causing interference (C6). 919 mod 30 = 1 (919 % 30 = 1). 737 % 30 = 7 (or 7?). 737 mod 30 = 7. So not same.\n\nC5 Frequent handovers degrade performance. We see at 10:25:34 to 10:25:35 there was handover? Actually at 10:25:34 serving PCI 919, at 10:25:35 still 919. The drop didn't involve handover. But at 10:25:37 served by 737. The throughput low may be due to handover. But the low throughput occurred at times 10:25:35 and 10:25:36 before handover. No handover yet. So maybe due to cell-specific issue.\n\nC2: Serving coverage distance >1km. The vehicle near 128.139682, 32.623035. The gNodeB location is 128.139529, 32.623035, same location. So near. So not distance > 1km.\n\nC1: Down tilt too large causing weak coverage at far end. The mechanical downtilt values: for cell 15: 4 deg. Digital tilt 8 deg. 6. But what is the actual downtilt? In description: default electronic downtilt 255 representing 6 degrees. Other values represent actual downtilt angle in degrees. So digital tilt is 8 degrees actual tilt. mechanical downtilt 4 degrees. So combined? The electronic downtilt default 255 not specified. Actually gNodeB parameters list 'Digital Tilt' as 8. So maybe tilt is 8 deg. I think not too large.\n\nC3: A neighboring cell provides higher throughput. Not applicable.\n\nC7: Vehicle speed >40km/h, but speeds only <= 38.\n\nC8: Average scheduled RBs below 160, affecting throughput. What is the RB scheduling? It's 5G KPIs line: '5G KPI PCell Layer1 DL RB Num (Including 0)' column. At times of low throughput: 10:25:35 RB=160; 10:25:36 RB=186; 10:25:34 RB=161. So at 10:25:35 RB 160 exactly at threshold? Average scheduled RBs below 160 maybe cause low throughput. But at 10:25:35 RBC 160 equals threshold. 0.14 throughput. So maybe not.\n\nC4: Non-colocated co-frequency neighboring cells cause severe overlapping coverage. Possibly 919 and 737 are co-frequency? Not given.\n\nAlternatively, the cause might be due to digital tilt vs beam scenario causing mismatch causing coverage weak at edges. The measurement of SS-RSRP at 10:25:36 is -82.19. Not too bad. SINR 8.41, not low. Throughput only 13 Mbps.\n\nBut at 10:25:35 SS-RSRP -78.15, SINR 8.5 but throughput 0.14; This is due to scheduling?\n\nCheck neighbor cell BRSRP values: -81.71, -95.46, -105 for neighbor 1, 2, 3. So there is interference but not huge.\n\nAlso the scheduled RB number is 160; at 10:25:35 RB 160 might saturate but still low throughput. Might be due to RRC cell parameter?\n\nMaybe the cause is same PCI mod 30 causing interference: 919 mod 30 = 1; 737 mod 30 = 7. Not same.\n\nLet's search for the 5G KPIs: Perhaps the throughput dip due to \"Serving cell RSRP to neighbor ratio\" etc. But root cause list limited.\n\nWhich root cause best fits?\n\nWe saw that throughput low 0-13 at ~1 km/h speed but at 28 km/h also low (0.14). At 1 km/h we still see 13 Mbps, maybe due to heavy interference? Actually RSRP at 1 km/h is -82.19, SINR 8.41. Throughput 13Mbps. For -78.15 RSRP, SINR 8.5, throughput 0.14.\n\nSo RSRP improved but throughput low. Might be due to interference? But BRSRP neighbor -81.71.\n\nBut why neighbor's BRSRP -81 dBm? Similar to own RSRP magnitude. Could cause interference.\n\nAlso at 10:25:35 average scheduled RB 160. At 10:25:36 average scheduled RB 186 > 160. So throughput increase from 0.14 to 13.23.\n\nMaybe the root cause is \"Average scheduled RBs below 160\" but here average RBs are 160 or above. So not that.\n\nBut maybe in other road sections where throughput dropped below 600, average RBs were below 160. But we only have sample.\n\nAlso check beam scenario difference: cell 919 uses SCENARIO_1 with 6° beam width. That might be too narrow affecting some directions. If vehicle passes far from main lobe, throughput drop. The downtilt maybe small 4 degree.\n\nThe mechanical azimuth 100 deg, digital azimuth 0 deg? For cell 919, Mechanical Azimuth 100 deg (?). Actually gNodeB table shows for Cell ID 15 (PCI 919): Mechanical Azimuth 100, Mechanical Downtilt 4, Digital Tilt 8, Digital\n</think>\n"

              "type": "reasoning",
              "reasoning": "We need to determine why throughput dropping below 600Mbps in certain road sections. Looking at drive test data, throughput: first row 600.0 at 34 km/h, second row drop to 0.14 at 28 km/h, third 13.23 at 1 km/h, then 146 at 38 km/h etc. But the issue is dropping below 600Mbps – the second row is zero, so below 600 obviously. We need root cause from 8 possible. Let's analyze scenarios. Consider which parameters change across timestamps. Throughput seems correlated with PCIs: The serving PCI column changes among 919 and 737. The neighbor cell top 1 PCI also changes between 737 and 919. There is interplay: when serving PCI is 919, neighbor PCI top 1 is 737. When serving PCI 737, neighbor PCI top 1 is 919. Also throughput high when serving PCI 919 except second row. Let's inspect SRSRP values: when serving PCI 919, SS-RSRP: row 1 (-80.48), row 2 (-78.15), row 3 (-82.19), row 4 when PCIs swapped: serving PCI 737 -> SS-RSRP -88.07 (worse). So throughput lower when RSRP lower (e.g., -88 dBm vs -80 dBm). That might cause lower throughput. Also at second row PCIs same but throughput 0.14 due to RSRP slightly better? Wait: second row: serving PCI 919, RSRP -78.15 (better than -80.48). But throughput is low. So maybe due to interference? Let's check neighboring cell BRSRP: For row 2 (serving 919), neighbor PCI 36 has BRSRP -81.12; neighbor PCI 737 BRSRP -95.46; neighbor PCI 430 BRSRP -105.01. So neighbor cells 737 has -95.46 (close). That might cause interference? But if serving PCI 919 has RSRP -78.15 and neighbor 737 -95.46, still should be decent? The throughput 0.14 means maybe handover in progress, or scheduling issue due to low RB. The RB count row 2: 160 -> average scheduled RBs below 160? Wait column 5G PCell Layer1 DL RB Num includes 0? The values: 161.0, 160.0, 186.0, 180.0, 173.2, 168.69, 165.05, 161.93, 171.97, 177.81. All above 160. So C8 maybe not relevant.\n\nLet's analyze root causes:\n\nC1: Serving cell's downtilt too large, causing weak coverage at far end. But we don't have evidence of far end; speeds vary. Throughput drop occurs even at low speed (row 3). BRSRP might be lower at far end. Not sure.\n\nC2: Cover distance exceeds 1km, resulting in over-shooting. Not in list.\n\nC3: A neighboring cell provides higher throughput. But we see near high throughput at PCIs swapped? But we may not know.\n\nC4: Non-colocated co-frequency neighboring cells cause severe overlapping coverage. That could cause heavy interference if two cells share frequency and are not co-located. The engineering parameters show cells: cell IDs 1,26,15,5,24 with same gNodeB 0000258. They likely non-colocated? Actually same gNodeB but different cells; they are co-located? They may be neighboring cells on same gNodeB, maybe not co-located. But \"Non-colocated co-frequency neighboring cells\" may cause overlap. This could explain throughput drop.\n\nC5: Frequent handovers degrade performance. Handovers might happen at certain points? But we don't see explicit handover metrics. However throughput drop occurs at second row quickly after first row, maybe handover? But it's still same serving PCI 919. Not changing.\n\nC6: Neighbor cell and serving cell have same PCI mod 30, leading to interference. Check PCIs: 919 mod 30 = 919 % 30 = 19 (since 30*30=900, remainder 19). Serving PCI 919, neighbor cells are 737, 36, 430. 737 %30 = 737-30*24=737-720=17. 36%30=6. 430%30=20. But also neighbor PCI 36 maybe not. But second row neighbor cell 430 also present? yes neighbor 430 -105 dBm. 430 mod 30=20. None share same remainder as serving 19. But when serving PCI 737 (second row when switched) 737%30=17; neighbor 919%30=19. Not same. So C6 unlikely.\n\nC7: Vehicle speed >40 km/h impacting throughput. That would reduce throughput, but we see throughput high at speed 38 (146) and 40 not exceeding? Actually only 38, 40? Speed 38 and 34, 36 etc. But throughput 150-300 at speeds >30. But drop to zero at 28 km/h. So speed not main.\n\nC8: Average scheduled RBs below 160, impacting throughput. RB counts are above 160 except maybe 160 exactly. Row 2 is 160.0 (equal). But below 160 would be <160; not here.\n\nThus root cause may be interference due to overlapping neighboring cells (C4). But we must consider C1: downtilt too large. Engineering parameters show mechanical downtilt for cell 15 4 degrees, 4; digital tilt 8; but for cell 1 mechanical 3 degrees; digital tilt 7; but not too large. 255 means 6 deg. So 6 deg? Mechanical downtilt small. So not.\n\nC2: coverage distance >1 km? Not relevant.\n\nC3: neighbor cell provides higher throughput. But we see neighbor cell 919 may have high throughput, but our serving cell 919 had high throughput until low.\n\nLet's examine patterns: when serving PCI 919 at row1 throughput 600; row2 throughput 0.14; row3 throughput 13.23; row4 serving 737 throughput 146; row5 315; row6 1056; row7 1085; row8 1102; row9 1091; row10 1010. The drop occurs from row1 to row2 drastically. Speed slightly decreased from 34 to 28. RSRP improved from -80.48 to -78.15. But neighbor cells? At row1 neighbor PCI 36 and 737 and 430 have BRSRP -83.89, -95.49, -102.53; at row2 neighbor PCI 36 remains? Top 1 neighbor 36 BRSRP -81.12. So neighbor values changed little. Throughput zero suggests maybe cell has not scheduled any RBs due to call drop or blocked due to measurement. Could be cause C5: frequent handovers degrade performance; perhaps the test vehicle moved rapidly across cell boundary causing HOs but throughput shows HO. But the serving PCI remains same 919, no change. But maybe the test triggers a handover failure? Actually, second row shows throughput 0.14 but RSRP moderate. Could be due to \"Neighbor cell and serving cell having same PCI mod 30\"? but not.\n\nWe can check if neighbor 'Top 1 PCI' being 36, 30? Wait top 1 neighbor is 36. That is not co-frequency cell? But maybe cell 36 is a neighbor cell. The presence of neighbor 36 may cause interference if same PCI mod 30 as serving? Serving 919 gives remainder 19. 36 remainder 6. Not same.\n\nMaybe the drop is due to Non-colocated co-frequency neighboring cells (C4). Cells 919 and 737 sharing same gNodeB but placed 15m apart? Actually gNodeB ID 0000258 host cells 1,26,15,5,24. They are co-located? We can't know. But non-colocated co-frequency cells can cause interference: if two cells (different site) reuse frequency. But the engineering parameters only show gNodeB ID 0000258 for all cells; maybe all are at same site. So might be colocated. So not.\n\nConsider C2: coverage distance exceeds 1km causing over-shooting. The test vehicle stops at small distance? Not.\n\nLet's analyze the measured throughput values >600: row6 1056, row7 1085, row8 1102, row9 1091, row10 1010. These high values correspond to serving PCI 737. So the throughput high when serving PCI 737. But why was it low at row2-3 when serving PCI 919? Because perhaps the 919 cell is not covering fully due to downtilt or geometry. Actually the first row had RSRP -80 dBm and throughput 600. The following rows when serving cell is 919 but speed changes but throughput drastically decreases. But at row4 with serving PCI 737, throughput recovers >146 etc. So maybe the 919 cell had interference due to neighbor 737? At row4, neighbor 919 BRSRP -88.46 (worse) but still throughput high. However at row2, neighbor 919 might be not measured? Wait row2 neighbor PCI 36 BRSRP -81.12; neighbor 737 BRSRP -95.46; neighbor 430 BRSRP -105.01. So far same.\n\nWait",

                  "reasoning": "We need to select the most likely root cause from list. Evaluate each:\n\nC1: Serving cell downtilt too large. We have mechanical downtilt values for cell with serving PCI 919 (cell 15) is 4 degrees mechanical, digital 8 -> combined maybe 12 degrees? That's not large > 6 deg. So less likely.\n\nC2: Coverage distance >1km leading to over-shooting. Not evidence.\n\nC3: Neighbor cell provides higher throughput. But throughput dropping below 600 occurs when neighbor cell may be dominating? Actually throughput high when 737 cell; drop when 919 cell. If neighbor cell 737 provides higher throughput, the test vehicle might have been served by that node in other sections. But drop occurs in road sections? Not sure.\n\nC4: Non-colocated co-frequency neighboring cells cause severe overlapping coverage. Might cause interference causing low throughput. But we need evidence. The two cells 737 and 919 are co-located at same gNodeB? They are maybe not co-located? It's same gNodeB ID 0000258, but still could be different physical cells at same site? Actually \"Non-colocated co-frequency neighboring cells\" implies cells are from different sites. So if they are all at the same site, they are colocated. But we don't know if 919 cell served by a different gNodeB than 737? Wait the data shows only gNodeB ID 0000258 for all cells. But maybe this includes multiple cells of same site. So they are colocated. So C4 not.\n\nC5: Frequent handovers degrade performance. But there is no handover event shown. But throughput drop could coincide with handover. In data row2, handing to another cell? However service PCI remains 919. So maybe not.\n\nC6: Neighbor cell and serving cell have same PCI mod 30, causing interference. We check remainders; no match. So not.\n\nC7: Vehicle speed >40 km/h affecting throughput. Speeds are <40. So not.\n\nC8: Average scheduled RBs below 160. RB counts are 160.0 in row2 borderline but not below. So not.\n\nThus none fit well. Which might be the best likely? Perhaps C1 because downtilt too large could cause coverage issues causing low throughput when moving away from base station. But our data show strong RSRP at high throughput and weak at low throughput? Wait row2 RSRP -78.15 good. So not due to distance.\n\nMaybe the cause is C3: neighbor cell provides higher throughput. For road sections, throughput dropping below 600 maybe because test vehicle is served by cell 919 with lower throughput due to neighbor (but neighbor 737 might be higher). But the data shows throughput for cell 919 is high 600 initially then drops to 0.14. So neighbor 737 provided better throughput maybe but test vehicle not served by it due to handover issues or scheduling.\n\nHowever, we might need to pick the most plausible root cause. Based on the data patterns, it looks like when service switches from cell 919 to 737, throughput goes from ~0 to >600. Thus the cause might be that at the lower throughput region, the 919 cell (with serving PCI 919) had a weak link due to downtilt causing insufficient coverage at that road section. So C1 fits: serving cell downtilt too large causing weak coverage at far end. That would reduce throughput. At the farther road sections, maybe due to down-tilt of 919 cell, coverage dips causing poor throughput. The data also show RSRP high though? Wait RSRP for 919 cell at row1 -80, at row2 -78.15 good. So maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the issue is more like C5: Frequent handovers degrade performance because the vehicle moves quickly between cells (919 and 737). The throughput dropping significantly could be due to handover failures or switching. The data shows near zero throughput for a moment when maybe a handover occurs? Could be due to 1-second measurement after handover. So C5 might be best.\n\nLet's examine speed and throughput differences: throughput 0.14 at 28 km/h but high at 1 km/h (13.23) and 38 km/h (146). But 0.14 at 28 km/h likely due to an event not speed. So maybe handover. So C5: Frequent handovers degrade performance. That seems plausible.\n\nWhich root cause from list is most plausible given limited info? I'd choose C5.",

        "0742ca3df70151154b757631cc8e7e3a": "We need to determine why throughput dropping below 600Mbps in certain road sections. Looking at drive test data, throughput: first row 600.0 at 34 km/h, second row drop to 0.14 at 28 km/h, third 13.23 at 1 km/h, then 146 at 38 km/h etc. But the issue is dropping below 600Mbps – the second row is zero, so below 600 obviously. We need root cause from 8 possible. Let's analyze scenarios. Consider which parameters change across timestamps. Throughput seems correlated with PCIs: The serving PCI column changes among 919 and 737. The neighbor cell top 1 PCI also changes between 737 and 919. There is interplay: when serving PCI is 919, neighbor PCI top 1 is 737. When serving PCI 737, neighbor PCI top 1 is 919. Also throughput high when serving PCI 919 except second row. Let's inspect SRSRP values: when serving PCI 919, SS-RSRP: row 1 (-80.48), row 2 (-78.15), row 3 (-82.19), row 4 when PCIs swapped: serving PCI 737 -> SS-RSRP -88.07 (worse). So throughput lower when RSRP lower (e.g., -88 dBm vs -80 dBm). That might cause lower throughput. Also at second row PCIs same but throughput 0.14 due to RSRP slightly better? Wait: second row: serving PCI 919, RSRP -78.15 (better than -80.48). But throughput is low. So maybe due to interference? Let's check neighboring cell BRSRP: For row 2 (serving 919), neighbor PCI 36 has BRSRP -81.12; neighbor PCI 737 BRSRP -95.46; neighbor PCI 430 BRSRP -105.01. So neighbor cells 737 has -95.46 (close). That might cause interference? But if serving PCI 919 has RSRP -78.15 and neighbor 737 -95.46, still should be decent? The throughput 0.14 means maybe handover in progress, or scheduling issue due to low RB. The RB count row 2: 160 -> average scheduled RBs below 160? Wait column 5G PCell Layer1 DL RB Num includes 0? The values: 161.0, 160.0, 186.0, 180.0, 173.2, 168.69, 165.05, 161.93, 171.97, 177.81. All above 160. So C8 maybe not relevant.\n\nLet's analyze root causes:\n\nC1: Serving cell's downtilt too large, causing weak coverage at far end. But we don't have evidence of far end; speeds vary. Throughput drop occurs even at low speed (row 3). BRSRP might be lower at far end. Not sure.\n\nC2: Cover distance exceeds 1km, resulting in over-shooting. Not in list.\n\nC3: A neighboring cell provides higher throughput. But we see near high throughput at PCIs swapped? But we may not know.\n\nC4: Non-colocated co-frequency neighboring cells cause severe overlapping coverage. That could cause heavy interference if two cells share frequency and are not co-located. The engineering parameters show cells: cell IDs 1,26,15,5,24 with same gNodeB 0000258. They likely non-colocated? Actually same gNodeB but different cells; they are co-located? They may be neighboring cells on same gNodeB, maybe not co-located. But \"Non-colocated co-frequency neighboring cells\" may cause overlap. This could explain throughput drop.\n\nC5: Frequent handovers degrade performance. Handovers might happen at certain points? But we don't see explicit handover metrics. However throughput drop occurs at second row quickly after first row, maybe handover? But it's still same serving PCI 919. Not changing.\n\nC6: Neighbor cell and serving cell have same PCI mod 30, leading to interference. Check PCIs: 919 mod 30 = 919 % 30 = 19 (since 30*30=900, remainder 19). Serving PCI 919, neighbor cells are 737, 36, 430. 737 %30 = 737-30*24=737-720=17. 36%30=6. 430%30=20. But also neighbor PCI 36 maybe not. But second row neighbor cell 430 also present? yes neighbor 430 -105 dBm. 430 mod 30=20. None share same remainder as serving 19. But when serving PCI 737 (second row when switched) 737%30=17; neighbor 919%30=19. Not same. So C6 unlikely.\n\nC7: Vehicle speed >40 km/h impacting throughput. That would reduce throughput, but we see throughput high at speed 38 (146) and 40 not exceeding? Actually only 38, 40? Speed 38 and 34, 36 etc. But throughput 150-300 at speeds >30. But drop to zero at 28 km/h. So speed not main.\n\nC8: Average scheduled RBs below 160, impacting throughput. RB counts are above 160 except maybe 160 exactly. Row 2 is 160.0 (equal). But below 160 would be <160; not here.\n\nThus root cause may be interference due to overlapping neighboring cells (C4). But we must consider C1: downtilt too large. Engineering parameters show mechanical downtilt for cell 15 4 degrees, 4; digital tilt 8; but for cell 1 mechanical 3 degrees; digital tilt 7; but not too large. 255 means 6 deg. So 6 deg? Mechanical downtilt small. So not.\n\nC2: coverage distance >1 km? Not relevant.\n\nC3: neighbor cell provides higher throughput. But we see neighbor cell 919 may have high throughput, but our serving cell 919 had high throughput until low.\n\nLet's examine patterns: when serving PCI 919 at row1 throughput 600; row2 throughput 0.14; row3 throughput 13.23; row4 serving 737 throughput 146; row5 315; row6 1056; row7 1085; row8 1102; row9 1091; row10 1010. The drop occurs from row1 to row2 drastically. Speed slightly decreased from 34 to 28. RSRP improved from -80.48 to -78.15. But neighbor cells? At row1 neighbor PCI 36 and 737 and 430 have BRSRP -83.89, -95.49, -102.53; at row2 neighbor PCI 36 remains? Top 1 neighbor 36 BRSRP -81.12. So neighbor values changed little. Throughput zero suggests maybe cell has not scheduled any RBs due to call drop or blocked due to measurement. Could be cause C5: frequent handovers degrade performance; perhaps the test vehicle moved rapidly across cell boundary causing HOs but throughput shows HO. But the serving PCI remains same 919, no change. But maybe the test triggers a handover failure? Actually, second row shows throughput 0.14 but RSRP moderate.

But maybe cell 36 is a neighbor cell. The presence of neighbor 36 may cause interference if same PCI mod 30 as serving? Serving 919 gives remainder 19. 36 remainder 6. Not same.\n\nMaybe the drop is due to Non-colocated co-frequency neighboring cells (C4). Cells 919 and 737 sharing same gNodeB but placed 15m apart? Actually gNodeB ID 0000258 host cells 1,26,15,5,24. They are co-located? We can't know. But non-colocated co-frequency cells can cause interference: if two cells (different site) reuse frequency. But the engineering parameters only show gNodeB ID 0000258 for all cells; maybe all are at same site. So might be colocated. So not.\n\nConsider C2: coverage distance exceeds 1km causing over-shooting. The test vehicle stops at small distance?

So the throughput high when serving PCI 737. But why was it low at row2-3 when serving PCI 919? Because perhaps the 919 cell is not covering fully due to downtilt or geometry. Actually the first row had RSRP -80 dBm and throughput 600. The following rows when serving cell is 919 but speed changes but throughput drastically decreases. But at row4 with serving PCI 737, throughput recovers >146 etc. So maybe the 919 cell had interference due to neighbor 737? At row4, neighbor 919 BRSRP -88.46 (worse) but still throughput high. However at row2, neighbor 919 might be not measured? Wait row2 neighbor PCI 36 BRSRP -81.12; neighbor 737 BRSRP -95.46; neighbor 430 BRSRP -105.01. So far same.\n\nWait",
        "ed3323614656efd31ba33707cdb82a0d": "<think>\nWe need to determine why throughput dropping below 600Mbps in certain road sections. Looking at drive test data, throughput: first row 600.0 at 34 km/h, second row drop to 0.14 at 28 km/h, third 13.23 at 1 km/h, then 146 at 38 km/h etc. But the issue is dropping below 600Mbps – the second row is zero, so below 600 obviously. We need root cause from 8 possible. Let's analyze scenarios. Consider which parameters change across timestamps. Throughput seems correlated with PCIs: The serving PCI column changes among 919 and 737. The neighbor cell top 1 PCI also changes between 737 and 919. There is interplay: when serving PCI is 919, neighbor PCI top 1 is 737. When serving PCI 737, neighbor PCI top 1 is 919. Also throughput high when serving PCI 919 except second row. Let's inspect SRSRP values: when serving PCI 919, SS-RSRP: row 1 (-80.48), row 2 (-78.15), row 3 (-82.19), row 4 when PCIs swapped: serving PCI 737 -> SS-RSRP -88.07 (worse). So throughput lower when RSRP lower (e.g., -88 dBm vs -80 dBm). That might cause lower throughput. Also at second row PCIs same but throughput 0.14 due to RSRP slightly better? Wait: second row: serving PCI 919, RSRP -78.15 (better than -80.48). But throughput is low. So maybe due to interference? Let's check neighboring cell BRSRP: For row 2 (serving 919), neighbor PCI 36 has BRSRP -81.12; neighbor PCI 737 BRSRP -95.46; neighbor PCI 430 BRSRP -105.01. So neighbor cells 737 has -95.46 (close). That might cause interference? But if serving PCI 919 has RSRP -78.15 and neighbor 737 -95.46, still should be decent? The throughput 0.14 means maybe handover in progress, or scheduling issue due to low RB. The RB count row 2: 160 -> average scheduled RBs below 160? Wait column 5G PCell Layer1 DL RB Num includes 0? The values: 161.0, 160.0, 186.0, 180.0, 173.2, 168.69, 165.05, 161.93, 171.97, 177.81. All above 160. So C8 maybe not relevant.\n\nLet's analyze root causes:\n\nC1: Serving cell's downtilt too large, causing weak coverage at far end. But we don't have evidence of far end; speeds vary. Throughput drop occurs even at low speed (row 3). BRSRP might be lower at far end. Not sure.\n\nC2: Cover distance exceeds 1km, resulting in over-shooting. Not in list.\n\nC3: A neighboring cell provides higher throughput. But we see near high throughput at PCIs swapped? But we may not know.\n\nC4: Non-colocated co-frequency neighboring cells cause severe overlapping coverage. That could cause heavy interference if two cells share frequency and are not co-located. The engineering parameters show cells: cell IDs 1,26,15,5,24 with same gNodeB 0000258. They likely non-colocated? Actually same gNodeB but different cells; they are co-located? They may be neighboring cells on same gNodeB, maybe not co-located. But \"Non-colocated co-frequency neighboring cells\" may cause overlap. This could explain throughput drop.\n\nC5: Frequent handovers degrade performance. Handovers might happen at certain points? But we don't see explicit handover metrics. However throughput drop occurs at second row quickly after first row, maybe handover? But it's still same serving PCI 919. Not changing.\n\nC6: Neighbor cell and serving cell have same PCI mod 30, leading to interference. Check PCIs: 919 mod 30 = 919 % 30 = 19 (since 30*30=900, remainder 19). Serving PCI 919, neighbor cells are 737, 36, 430. 737 %30 = 737-30*24=737-720=17. 36%30=6. 430%30=20. But also neighbor PCI 36 maybe not. But second row neighbor cell 430 also present? yes neighbor 430 -105 dBm. 430 mod 30=20. None share same remainder as serving 19. But when serving PCI 737 (second row when switched) 737%30=17; neighbor 919%30=19. Not same. So C6 unlikely.\n\nC7: Vehicle speed >40 km/h impacting throughput. That would reduce throughput, but we see throughput high at speed 38 (146) and 40 not exceeding? Actually only 38, 40? Speed 38 and 34, 36 etc. But throughput 150-300 at speeds >30. But drop to zero at 28 km/h. So speed not main.\n\nC8: Average scheduled RBs below 160, impacting throughput. RB counts are above 160 except maybe 160 exactly. Row 2 is 160.0 (equal). But below 160 would be <160; not here.\n\nThus root cause may be interference due to overlapping neighboring cells (C4). But we must consider C1: downtilt too large. Engineering parameters show mechanical downtilt for cell 15 4 degrees, 4; digital tilt 8; but for cell 1 mechanical 3 degrees; digital tilt 7; but not too large. 255 means 6 deg. So 6 deg? Mechanical downtilt small. So not.\n\nC2: coverage distance >1 km? Not relevant.\n\nC3: neighbor cell provides higher throughput. But we see neighbor cell 919 may have high throughput, but our serving cell 919 had high throughput until low.\n\nLet's examine patterns: when serving PCI 919 at row1 throughput 600; row2 throughput 0.14; row3 throughput 13.23; row4 serving 737 throughput 146; row5 315; row6 1056; row7 1085; row8 1102; row9 1091; row10 1010. The drop occurs from row1 to row2 drastically. Speed slightly decreased from 34 to 28. RSRP improved from -80.48 to -78.15. But neighbor cells? At row1 neighbor PCI 36 and 737 and 430 have BRSRP -83.89, -95.49, -102.53; at row2 neighbor PCI 36 remains? Top 1 neighbor 36 BRSRP -81.12. So neighbor values changed little. Throughput zero suggests maybe cell has not scheduled any RBs due to call drop or blocked due to measurement. Could be cause C5: frequent handovers degrade performance; perhaps the test vehicle moved rapidly across cell boundary causing HOs but throughput shows HO. But the serving PCI remains same 919, no change. But maybe the test triggers a handover failure? Actually, second row shows throughput 0.14 but RSRP moderate. Could be due to \"Neighbor cell and serving cell having same PCI mod 30\"? but not.\n\nWe can check if neighbor 'Top 1 PCI' being 36, 30? Wait top 1 neighbor is 36. That is not co-frequency cell? But maybe cell 36 is a neighbor cell. The presence of neighbor 36 may cause interference if same PCI mod 30 as serving? Serving 919 gives remainder 19. 36 remainder 6.

Actually gNodeB ID 0000258 host cells 1,26,15,5,24. They are co-located? We can't know. But non-colocated co-frequency cells can cause interference: if two cells (different site) reuse frequency. But the engineering parameters only show gNodeB ID 0000258 for all cells; maybe all are at same site. So might be colocated. So not.\n\nConsider C2: coverage distance exceeds 1km causing over-shooting. The test vehicle stops at small distance?

        "1988ec88d9c7aea80d03b3c38442c6ed": "We need to select the most likely root cause from list. Evaluate each:\n\nC1: Serving cell downtilt too large. We have mechanical downtilt values for cell with serving PCI 919 (cell 15) is 4 degrees mechanical, digital 8 -> combined maybe 12 degrees? That's not large > 6 deg. So less likely.\n\nC2: Coverage distance >1km leading to over-shooting. Not evidence.\n\nC3: Neighbor cell provides higher throughput. But throughput dropping below 600 occurs when neighbor cell may be dominating? Actually throughput high when 737 cell; drop when 919 cell. If neighbor cell 737 provides higher throughput, the test vehicle might have been served by that node in other sections. But drop occurs in road sections? Not sure.\n\nC4: Non-colocated co-frequency neighboring cells cause severe overlapping coverage. Might cause interference causing low throughput. But we need evidence. The two cells 737 and 919 are co-located at same gNodeB? They are maybe not co-located? It's same gNodeB ID 0000258, but still could be different physical cells at same site? Actually \"Non-colocated co-frequency neighboring cells\" implies cells are from different sites. So if they are all at the same site, they are colocated. But we don't know if 919 cell served by a different gNodeB than 737? Wait the data shows only gNodeB ID 0000258 for all cells. But maybe this includes multiple cells of same site. So they are colocated. So C4 not.\n\nC5: Frequent handovers degrade performance. But there is no handover event shown. But throughput drop could coincide with handover. In data row2, handing to another cell? However service PCI remains 919. So maybe not.\n\nC6: Neighbor cell and serving cell have same PCI mod 30, causing interference. We check remainders; no match. So not.\n\nC7: Vehicle speed >40 km/h affecting throughput. Speeds are <40. So not.\n\nC8: Average scheduled RBs below 160. RB counts are 160.0 in row2 borderline but not below. So not.\n\nThus none fit well. Which might be the best likely? Perhaps C1 because downtilt too large could cause coverage issues causing low throughput when moving away from base station. But our data show strong RSRP at high throughput and weak at low throughput? Wait row2 RSRP -78.15 good. So not due to distance.\n\nMaybe the cause is C3: neighbor cell provides higher throughput. For road sections, throughput dropping below 600 maybe because test vehicle is served by cell 919 with lower throughput due to neighbor (but neighbor 737 might be higher). But the data shows throughput for cell 919 is high 600 initially then drops to 0.14. So neighbor 737 provided better throughput maybe but test vehicle not served by it due to handover issues or scheduling.\n\nHowever, we might need to pick the most plausible root cause. Based on the data patterns, it looks like when service switches from cell 919 to 737, throughput goes from ~0 to >600. Thus the cause might be that at the lower throughput region, the 919 cell (with serving PCI 919) had a weak link due to downtilt causing insufficient coverage at that road section. So C1 fits: serving cell downtilt too large causing weak coverage at far end. That would reduce throughput. At the farther road sections, maybe due to down-tilt of 919 cell, coverage dips causing poor throughput. The data also show RSRP high though? Wait RSRP for 919 cell at row1 -80, at row2 -78.15 good. So maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the issue is more like C5: Frequent handovers degrade performance because the vehicle moves quickly between cells (919 and 737). The throughput dropping significantly could be due to handover failures or switching. The data shows near zero throughput for a moment when maybe a handover occurs? Could be due to 1-second measurement after handover. So C5 might be best.\n\nLet's examine speed and throughput differences: throughput 0.14 at 28 km/h but high at 1 km/h (13.23) and 38 km/h (146). But 0.14 at 28 km/h likely due to an event not speed. So maybe handover. So C5: Frequent handovers degrade performance. That seems plausible.\n\nWhich root cause from list is most plausible given limited info? I'd choose C5.",

              "reasoning": "We need to analyze drive-test throughputs dropping below 600Mbps in certain road sections. There's data for 10 seconds (timestamps). Throughput values: At 10:25:34, throughput is 600; then 0.14 at 35; then 13 at 36; 146 at 37; 315 at 38; 1056 at 39; 1085 at 40; 1102 at 41; 1091 at 42; 1010 at 43. So only one section below 600: at 10:25:34 and 35 maybe 0-600. Actually at 10:25:35, throughput 0.14 <600. 10:25:36 throughput 13 <600. 10:25:37 146 <600. So 34,35,36,37 are low (<600). 38-43 high >600. So drop occurs at times 10:25:34-37.\n\nNeed to identify root cause among 8 candidates.\n\nWe must consider engineering parameters: gNodeBs: cell IDs 1,15, etc. Throughput drop maybe due to poor coverage due to downtilt issues, handover, interference, low RB scheduling, high speed, etc.\n\nLet's review 5G KPI values: For 10:25:34: PCell PCI 919, SS-RSRP -80.48, SS-SINR 11.59; Neighbor top 1 PCI 737; top 2 36, etc. Throughput 600.0. For 10:25:35: PCell PCI 919; SS-RSRP -78.15; SINR 8.5; throughput 0.14. So RSRP slightly better but throughput near zero. So maybe handover?\n\nWe should also inspect cell parameters: Cell ID 15 has PCI 919, so 919 is serving. Cell ID 1 has PCI 737. In data, 10:25:34-37 the serving PCI is 919. Then at 38-43, remains 919? Actually 38 shows 737 as serving? Check: At 10:25:38: Serving PCI 737. Throughput high. Then 10:25:39: Serving PCI 737 again. So the drop occurs with serving PCI 919? Actually drop times with 919: 34-37. After 38, serving changes to 737 with high throughput.\n\nThus the drop might be due to serving cell 919 not providing enough capacity due to interference or resource allocation.\n\nCandidate root causes:\nC1: Serv. cell downtilt too large causing weak coverage at far end.\nC2: Coverage distance exceeds 1km, over-shooting.\nC3: Neighbor cell provides higher throughput.\nC4: Non-colocated co-frequency neighboring cells cause severe overlapping coverage.\nC5: Frequent handovers degrade performance.\nC6: Neighbor and serving same PCI mod 30, interference.\nC7: Vehicle speed >40 km/h.\nC8: Avg scheduled RBs below 160.\n\nNow examine conditions:\n\n- Speed during drop: 34 km/h at 34; 28 at 35; 1 at 36; 38 at 37. So speeds 28-38 km/h, below 40 km/h. So C7 unlikely.\n\n- RB number: check last column: 5G KPI PCell Layer1 DL RB Num. At 34: 161 RBs (>=160). At 35: 160. At 36: 186. At 37: 180. So average scheduled RBs not below 160.\n\n- Beam scenario: For cell 15 is SCENARIO_1 (vertical beamwidth 6). digital tilt 255? Actually Digital Tilt 255 is default? We know electronic downtilt 255 represents 6 degrees. For cell 26: digital tilt 255, beam scenario default. But what is digital tilt for cell 15? It's 8 (so 8 degrees). Mechanical tilt 4. So effective tilting?\n\n- For serving cell 919: that's cell ID 15. Digital tilt 8 degrees (actual). But the problem states digital tilt is the actual value? Not entirely. In engineering parameters we have Digital Tilt column. 8 means 8 degrees? Probably. However earlier note: default electronic downtilt value 255 representing 6 degrees. So 255 is 6 deg. 8 is 8 deg maybe? There's also Mechanical downtilt.\n\nPossible cause: The serving cell's vertical beamwidth maybe too narrow? But drop occurs at 919 maybe due to coverage distance too far due to too high down tilt. But drop occurs near end but after 1 km? Check distance from cell location: gNodeB center 128.139529, 32.623035. Vehicle positions ~128.139682 close. So distance small (~50-100m). So not coverage distance.\n\nMaybe interference from neighboring cell? Let's look at neighbor filtered Tx BRSRP values. At 34: filtered neighbor Rx values: top 1 -83.89, top 2 -95.49, top 3 -102.53. Service RSRP -80.48: better. At 35: service RSRP -78.15, neighbor top 1 -81.71, top 2 -95.46, top 3 -105.01. So service RSRP still better. Throughput zero maybe due to low SINR? But 35's SINR 8.5 dB. 34's 11.59, 36's 8.41, 37's 11.04. So SINR not high but not zero. Throughput still zero. Could be due to frequent handover? Let's check change in serving PCI at 35? It remains 919 at 34-37. So no change.\n\nMaybe problem due to cell coverage distance exceeding 1 km? But no.\n\nCheck that neighbor PCIs: 737, 36, 430 etc. Could be interference cause due to PCI conflict? Check C6: Neighbor cell and serving cell have the same PCI mod 30 leading interference. Let's compute 919 mod 30 => 919 mod 30 = 919 - 30*30 = 919-900 = 19. 737 mod 30 = 737-30*24=737-720=17. So not same.\n\nC4: Non-colocated co-frequency neighboring cells cause severe overlapping coverage. Are there non-colocated neighboring cells with same frequency? We don't know. But the drop occurs only for 919; when switching to 737 throughput high. So maybe cell 919 is not colocated? The gNodeBs for 919: cell ID 15 at same gNodeB ID 0000258. Are there other cells at same gNodeB? Yes cell 26 maybe. But they are with different PCI. 919's neighbors: 737, 36, etc. But the issue might be that 919's digital tilt 8, mechanical tilt 4, but default downtilt of 255 for some cells? Actually cell 26 (PCI 291) has Downtilt 255 = 6 deg default. Might not match.\n\nC1: Serving cell's downtilt angle too large, causing weak coverage at far end. If downtilt too large, coverage is lower. Could be cause: At far end of road section (the drop occurs). But the vehicle is small distance from cell. So maybe the far end relative to far side of cell? Not.\n\nC5: Frequent handovers degrade performance. In data, do we see many handover events? Serving PCI changes from 919 to 737 at 38. That's one handover. Only one. So not frequent.\n\nC2: coverage distance >1km. Not.\n\nC8: scheduled RB below 160; but we had 160 or above.\n\nThus maybe the root cause due to high digital tilt causing low RACH? Wait maybe not.\n\nLook at 'Beam Scenario' and 'vertical beamwidth' relationships: Cell 15 has SCENARIO_1 -> vertical beamwidth 6 degrees. Digital tilt 8 degrees maybe relative? But the system indicates if beam scenario is set to default or SCENARIO_1 to SCENARIO_5, vertical beamwidth 6 deg. So cell 15 is within 6 deg. Might be adequate.\n\nBut drop occurs for 919 which is cell 15. Maybe interfering neighbor cell 737? For 919, neighbor 737 has RSRP: -83.89 at 34; neighbor 737 is lower by about 3 dB. So interference moderate.\n\nCould drop be due to high interference from non-colocated cells with same PCI mod 30? Not.\n\nWhat about C3: A neighboring cell provides higher throughput. Indeed when 919 serving, throughput low; when 737 serving, throughput high. So indeed a neighboring cell (737) provides higher performance. So maybe root cause: the neighbor cell (737) has better beam alignment or coverage, but the device is not handed over due to handover algorithm misconfiguration? But why drop <600? Actually 919 throughput low because neighbor 737 has better conditions; maybe interference still? But root cause likely C3: neighbor cell provides higher throughput.\n\nBut is that a root cause? The problem says \"reason for throughput dropping below 600Mbps in certain road sections.\" In data, when serving PCI 919 with low RSRP (80dBm) but neighbor 737 with slightly lower RSRP but similar throughput high: This suggests that cell 919's RSRP is borderline and throughput lower; but neighbor cell 737 provides higher throughput (when switched). So root cause may be that serving cell has weaker",

                  "reasoning": "We need to pick the most likely root cause among eight. My reasoning: throughput drop occurs for 919 while neighbor 737 high throughput. The root cause likely due to neighbor cell providing higher throughput and interference leading to lower throughput. Option C3 states: \"A neighboring cell provides higher throughput.\" That might be the cause: because the device is still served by 919, but the neighbor 737 would have given higher throughput. However, the cause might actually be interference or insufficient resources.\n\nBut maybe it's more specifically \"Non-colocated co-frequency neighboring cells cause severe overlapping coverage.\" Did we see non-colocated? Not sure.\n\nGiven the question: \"Analyze the 5G wireless network drive-test user plane data and engineering parameters.\" We look at 'digital tilt', 'beam scenario', 'covering distance', etc. Maybe the problem is due to \"Serving cell's downtilt angle too large...\" leading to weak coverage at far end. At lower speeds? Throughput low. But vehicle is near cell so maybe it's far end relative to road section.\n\nHowever check 'Digital Tilt' of serving cell 919 is 8°, but mechanical tilt 4°, digital tilt 8°. This seems moderate. But there is 'Beam Scenario' SCENARIO_1 vertical beamwidth 6°. So maybe the coverage is not enough across road segment near 0? I doubt.\n\nLet's check RSRP values: at 34 -80.48, 35 -78.15 which is better, yet throughput 0.14. So RSRP not sole cause. SINR 8.5 dB also not too low (should support >600?). 600 Mbps require high spectral efficiency maybe >2 bits/s/Hz requiring high SINR >10-15 dB? However if RBs scheduled low, throughput may be limited. But RB numbers high. So maybe a misconfiguration of max TX power? Not.\n\nThe drop occurs when serving PCI 919 at times 34-37. At 38 the serving changed to 737 and throughput skyrockets. This could imply that the device is stuck in the wrong cell until scheduled handover triggers at 38. In between, the device gets poor throughput because the channel to 919 is suboptimal compared to 737. So root cause could be \"Neighbor cell provides higher throughput\" causing that the device remains on a suboptimal cell. Option C3 might be the best cause.\n\nI'll produce answer \"C3\".",

        "43a018a4873a4806a61bc2983caa3fa2": "We need to analyze drive-test throughputs dropping below 600Mbps in certain road sections. There's data for 10 seconds (timestamps). Throughput values: At 10:25:34, throughput is 600; then 0.14 at 35; then 13 at 36; 146 at 37; 315 at 38; 1056 at 39; 1085 at 40; 1102 at 41; 1091 at 42; 1010 at 43. So only one section below 600: at 10:25:34 and 35 maybe 0-600. Actually at 10:25:35, throughput 0.14 <600. 10:25:36 throughput 13 <600. 10:25:37 146 <600. So 34,35,36,37 are low (<600). 38-43 high >600. So drop occurs at times 10:25:34-37.\n\nNeed to identify root cause among 8 candidates.\n\nWe must consider engineering parameters: gNodeBs: cell IDs 1,15, etc. Throughput drop maybe due to poor coverage due to downtilt issues, handover, interference, low RB scheduling, high speed, etc.\n\nLet's review 5G KPI values: For 10:25:34: PCell PCI 919, SS-RSRP -80.48, SS-SINR 11.59; Neighbor top 1 PCI 737; top 2 36, etc. Throughput 600.0. For 10:25:35: PCell PCI 919; SS-RSRP -78.15; SINR 8.5; throughput 0.14. So RSRP slightly better but throughput near zero. So maybe handover?\n\nWe should also inspect cell parameters: Cell ID 15 has PCI 919, so 919 is serving. Cell ID 1 has PCI 737. In data, 10:25:34-37 the serving PCI is 919. Then at 38-43, remains 919? Actually 38 shows 737 as serving? Check: At 10:25:38: Serving PCI 737. Throughput high. Then 10:25:39: Serving PCI 737 again. So the drop occurs with serving PCI 919? Actually drop times with 919: 34-37. After 38, serving changes to 737 with high throughput.\n\nThus the drop might be due to serving cell 919 not providing enough capacity due to interference or resource allocation.\n\nCandidate root causes:\nC1: Serv. cell downtilt too large causing weak coverage at far end.\nC2: Coverage distance exceeds 1km, over-shooting.\nC3: Neighbor cell provides higher throughput.\nC4: Non-colocated co-frequency neighboring cells cause severe overlapping coverage.\nC5: Frequent handovers degrade performance.\nC6: Neighbor and serving same PCI mod 30, interference.\nC7: Vehicle speed >40 km/h.\nC8: Avg scheduled RBs below 160.\n\nNow examine conditions:\n\n- Speed during drop: 34 km/h at 34; 28 at 35; 1 at 36; 38 at 37. So speeds 28-38 km/h, below 40 km/h. So C7 unlikely.\n\n- RB number: check last column: 5G KPI PCell Layer1 DL RB Num. At 34: 161 RBs (>=160). At 35: 160. At 36: 186. At 37: 180. So average scheduled RBs not below 160.\n\n- Beam scenario: For cell 15 is SCENARIO_1 (vertical beamwidth 6). digital tilt 255? Actually Digital Tilt 255 is default? We know electronic downtilt 255 represents 6 degrees. For cell 26: digital tilt 255, beam scenario default. But what is digital tilt for cell 15? It's 8 (so 8 degrees). Mechanical tilt 4. So effective tilting?\n\n- For serving cell 919: that's cell ID 15. Digital tilt 8 degrees (actual). But the problem states digital tilt is the actual value? Not entirely. In engineering parameters we have Digital Tilt column. 8 means 8 degrees? Probably. However earlier note: default electronic downtilt value 255 representing 6 degrees. So 255 is 6 deg. 8 is 8 deg maybe? There's also Mechanical downtilt.\n\nPossible cause: The serving cell's vertical beamwidth maybe too narrow? But drop occurs at 919 maybe due to coverage distance too far due to too high down tilt. But drop occurs near end but after 1 km? Check distance from cell location: gNodeB center 128.139529, 32.623035. Vehicle positions ~128.139682 close. So distance small (~50-100m). So not coverage distance.\n\nMaybe interference from neighboring cell? Let's look at neighbor filtered Tx BRSRP values. At 34: filtered neighbor Rx values: top 1 -83.89, top 2 -95.49, top 3 -102.53. Service RSRP -80.48: better. At 35: service RSRP -78.15, neighbor top 1 -81.71, top 2 -95.46, top 3 -105.01. So service RSRP still better. Throughput zero maybe due to low SINR? But 35's SINR 8.5 dB. 34's 11.59, 36's 8.41, 37's 11.04. So SINR not high but not zero. Throughput still zero. Could be due to frequent handover? Let's check change in serving PCI at 35? It remains 919 at 34-37. So no change.\n\nMaybe problem due to cell coverage distance exceeding 1 km? But no.\n\nCheck that neighbor PCIs: 737, 36, 430 etc. Could be interference cause due to PCI conflict? Check C6: Neighbor cell and serving cell have the same PCI mod 30 leading interference. Let's compute 919 mod 30 => 919 mod 30 = 919 - 30*30 = 919-900 = 19. 737 mod 30 = 737-30*24=737-720=17. So not same.\n\nC4: Non-colocated co-frequency neighboring cells cause severe overlapping coverage. Are there non-colocated neighboring cells with same frequency? We don't know. But the drop occurs only for 919; when switching to 737 throughput high. So maybe cell 919 is not colocated? The gNodeBs for 919: cell ID 15 at same gNodeB ID 0000258. Are there other cells at same gNodeB? Yes cell 26 maybe. But they are with different PCI. 919's neighbors: 737, 36, etc. But the issue might be that 919's digital tilt 8, mechanical tilt 4, but default downtilt of 255 for some cells? Actually cell 26 (PCI 291) has Downtilt 255 = 6 deg default. Might not match.\n\nC1: Serving cell's downtilt angle too large, causing weak coverage at far end. If downtilt too large, coverage is lower. Could be cause: At far end of road section (the drop occurs). But the vehicle is small distance from cell. So maybe the far end relative to far side of cell? Not.\n\nC5: Frequent handovers degrade performance. In data, do we see many handover events? Serving PCI changes from 919 to 737 at 38. That's one handover. Only one. So not frequent.\n\nC2: coverage distance >1km. Not.\n\nC8: scheduled RB below 160; but we had 160 or above.\n\nThus maybe the root cause due to high digital tilt causing low RACH? Wait maybe not.\n\nLook at 'Beam Scenario' and 'vertical beamwidth' relationships: Cell 15 has SCENARIO_1 -> vertical beamwidth 6 degrees. Digital tilt 8 degrees maybe relative? But the system indicates if beam scenario is set to default or SCENARIO_1 to SCENARIO_5, vertical beamwidth 6 deg. So cell 15 is within 6 deg. Might be adequate.\n\nBut drop occurs for 919 which is cell 15. Maybe interfering neighbor cell 737? For 919, neighbor 737 has RSRP: -83.89 at 34; neighbor 737 is lower by about 3 dB. So interference moderate.\n\nCould drop be due to high interference from non-colocated cells with same PCI mod 30? Not.\n\nWhat about C3: A neighboring cell provides higher throughput. Indeed when 919 serving, throughput low; when 737 serving, throughput high. So indeed a neighboring cell (737) provides higher performance. So maybe root cause: the neighbor cell (737) has better beam alignment or coverage, but the device is not handed over due to handover algorithm misconfiguration? But why drop <600? Actually 919 throughput low because neighbor 737 has better conditions; maybe interference still? But root cause likely C3: neighbor cell provides higher throughput.\n\nBut is that a root cause? The problem says \"reason for throughput dropping below 600Mbps in certain road sections.\" In data, when serving PCI 919 with low RSRP (80dBm) but neighbor 737 with slightly lower RSRP but similar throughput high: This suggests that cell 919's RSRP is borderline and throughput lower; but neighbor cell 737 provides higher throughput (when switched). So root cause may be that serving cell has weaker",

        "a0c810ee3fea53fdf091d14e79cfd8e7": "We need to pick the most likely root cause among eight. My reasoning: throughput drop occurs for 919 while neighbor 737 high throughput. The root cause likely due to neighbor cell providing higher throughput and interference leading to lower throughput. Option C3 states: \"A neighboring cell provides higher throughput.\" That might be the cause: because the device is still served by 919, but the neighbor 737 would have given higher throughput. However, the cause might actually be interference or insufficient resources.\n\nBut maybe it's more specifically \"Non-colocated co-frequency neighboring cells cause severe overlapping coverage.\" Did we see non-colocated? Not sure.\n\nGiven the question: \"Analyze the 5G wireless network drive-test user plane data and engineering parameters.\" We look at 'digital tilt', 'beam scenario', 'covering distance', etc. Maybe the problem is due to \"Serving cell's downtilt angle too large...\" leading to weak coverage at far end. At lower speeds? Throughput low. But vehicle is near cell so maybe it's far end relative to road section.\n\nHowever check 'Digital Tilt' of serving cell 919 is 8°, but mechanical tilt 4°, digital tilt 8°. This seems moderate. But there is 'Beam Scenario' SCENARIO_1 vertical beamwidth 6°. So maybe the coverage is not enough across road segment near 0? I doubt.\n\nLet's check RSRP values: at 34 -80.48, 35 -78.15 which is better, yet throughput 0.14. So RSRP not sole cause. SINR 8.5 dB also not too low (should support >600?). 600 Mbps require high spectral efficiency maybe >2 bits/s/Hz requiring high SINR >10-15 dB? However if RBs scheduled low, throughput may be limited. But RB numbers high. So maybe a misconfiguration of max TX power? Not.\n\nThe drop occurs when serving PCI 919 at times 34-37. At 38 the serving changed to 737 and throughput skyrockets. This could imply that the device is stuck in the wrong cell until scheduled handover triggers at 38. In between, the device gets poor throughput because the channel to 919 is suboptimal compared to 737. So root cause could be \"Neighbor cell provides higher throughput\" causing that the device remains on a suboptimal cell. Option C3 might be the best cause.\n\nI'll produce answer \"C3\".",
        "34b8b4b0e36680a0b6a8c70ffd3f58e9": "\n<think>\nWe need to analyze drive-test throughputs dropping below 600Mbps in certain road sections. There's data for 10 seconds (timestamps). Throughput values: At 10:25:34, throughput is 600; then 0.14 at 35; then 13 at 36; 146 at 37; 315 at 38; 1056 at 39; 1085 at 40; 1102 at 41; 1091 at 42; 1010 at 43. So only one section below 600: at 10:25:34 and 35 maybe 0-600. Actually at 10:25:35, throughput 0.14 <600. 10:25:36 throughput 13 <600. 10:25:37 146 <600. So 34,35,36,37 are low (<600). 38-43 high >600. So drop occurs at times 10:25:34-37.\n\nNeed to identify root cause among 8 candidates.\n\nWe must consider engineering parameters: gNodeBs: cell IDs 1,15, etc. Throughput drop maybe due to poor coverage due to downtilt issues, handover, interference, low RB scheduling, high speed, etc.\n\nLet's review 5G KPI values: For 10:25:34: PCell PCI 919, SS-RSRP -80.48, SS-SINR 11.59; Neighbor top 1 PCI 737; top 2 36, etc. Throughput 600.0. For 10:25:35: PCell PCI 919; SS-RSRP -78.15; SINR 8.5; throughput 0.14. So RSRP slightly better but throughput near zero. So maybe handover?\n\nWe should also inspect cell parameters: Cell ID 15 has PCI 919, so 919 is serving. Cell ID 1 has PCI 737. In data, 10:25:34-37 the serving PCI is 919. Then at 38-43, remains 919? Actually 38 shows 737 as serving? Check: At 10:25:38: Serving PCI 737. Throughput high. Then 10:25:39: Serving PCI 737 again. So the drop occurs with serving PCI 919? Actually drop times with 919: 34-37. After 38, serving changes to 737 with high throughput.\n\nThus the drop might be due to serving cell 919 not providing enough capacity due to interference or resource allocation.\n\nCandidate root causes:\nC1: Serv. cell downtilt too large causing weak coverage at far end.\nC2: Coverage distance exceeds 1km, over-shooting.\nC3: Neighbor cell provides higher throughput.\nC4: Non-colocated co-frequency neighboring cells cause severe overlapping coverage.\nC5: Frequent handovers degrade performance.\nC6: Neighbor and serving same PCI mod 30, interference.\nC7: Vehicle speed >40 km/h.\nC8: Avg scheduled RBs below 160.\n\nNow examine conditions:\n\n- Speed during drop: 34 km/h at 34; 28 at 35; 1 at 36; 38 at 37. So speeds 28-38 km/h, below 40 km/h. So C7 unlikely.\n\n- RB number: check last column: 5G KPI PCell Layer1 DL RB Num. At 34: 161 RBs (>=160). At 35: 160. At 36: 186. At 37: 180. So average scheduled RBs not below 160.\n\n- Beam scenario: For cell 15 is SCENARIO_1 (vertical beamwidth 6). digital tilt 255? Actually Digital Tilt 255 is default? We know electronic downtilt 255 represents 6 degrees. For cell 26: digital tilt 255, beam scenario default. But what is digital tilt for cell 15? It's 8 (so 8 degrees). Mechanical tilt 4. So effective tilting?\n\n- For serving cell 919: that's cell ID 15. Digital tilt 8 degrees (actual). But the problem states digital tilt is the actual value? Not entirely. In engineering parameters we have Digital Tilt column. 8 means 8 degrees? Probably. However earlier note: default electronic downtilt value 255 representing 6 degrees. So 255 is 6 deg. 8 is 8 deg maybe? There's also Mechanical downtilt.\n\nPossible cause: The serving cell's vertical beamwidth maybe too narrow? But drop occurs at 919 maybe due to coverage distance too far due to too high down tilt. But drop occurs near end but after 1 km? Check distance from cell location: gNodeB center 128.139529, 32.623035. Vehicle positions ~128.139682 close. So distance small (~50-100m). So not coverage distance.\n\nMaybe interference from neighboring cell? Let's look at neighbor filtered Tx BRSRP values. At 34: filtered neighbor Rx values: top 1 -83.89, top 2 -95.49, top 3 -102.53. Service RSRP -80.48: better. At 35: service RSRP -78.15, neighbor top 1 -81.71, top 2 -95.46, top 3 -105.01. So service RSRP still better. Throughput zero maybe due to low SINR? But 35's SINR 8.5 dB. 34's 11.59, 36's 8.41, 37's 11.04. So SINR not high but not zero. Throughput still zero. Could be due to frequent handover? Let's check change in serving PCI at 35? It remains 919 at 34-37. So no change.\n\nMaybe problem due to cell coverage distance exceeding 1 km? But no.\n\nCheck that neighbor PCIs: 737, 36, 430 etc. Could be interference cause due to PCI conflict? Check C6: Neighbor cell and serving cell have the same PCI mod 30 leading interference. Let's compute 919 mod 30 => 919 mod 30 = 919 - 30*30 = 919-900 = 19. 737 mod 30 = 737-30*24=737-720=17. So not same.\n\nC4: Non-colocated co-frequency neighboring cells cause severe overlapping coverage. Are there non-colocated neighboring cells with same frequency? We don't know. But the drop occurs only for 919; when switching to 737 throughput high. So maybe cell 919 is not colocated? The gNodeBs for 919: cell ID 15 at same gNodeB ID 0000258. Are there other cells at same gNodeB? Yes cell 26 maybe. But they are with different PCI. 919's neighbors: 737, 36, etc. But the issue might be that 919's digital tilt 8, mechanical tilt 4, but default downtilt of 255 for some cells? Actually cell 26 (PCI 291) has Downtilt 255 = 6 deg default. Might not match.\n\nC1: Serving cell's downtilt angle too large, causing weak coverage at far end. If downtilt too large, coverage is lower. Could be cause: At far end of road section (the drop occurs). But the vehicle is small distance from cell. So maybe the far end relative to far side of cell? Not.\n\nC5: Frequent handovers degrade performance. In data, do we see many handover events? Serving PCI changes from 919 to 737 at 38. That's one handover. Only one. So not frequent.\n\nC2: coverage distance >1km. Not.\n\nC8: scheduled RB below 160; but we had 160 or above.\n\nThus maybe the root cause due to high digital tilt causing low RACH? Wait maybe not.\n\nLook at 'Beam Scenario' and 'vertical beamwidth' relationships: Cell 15 has SCENARIO_1 -> vertical beamwidth 6 degrees. Digital tilt 8 degrees maybe relative? But the system indicates if beam scenario is set to default or SCENARIO_1 to SCENARIO_5, vertical beamwidth 6 deg. So cell 15 is within 6 deg. Might be adequate.\n\nBut drop occurs for 919 which is cell 15. Maybe interfering neighbor cell 737? For 919, neighbor 737 has RSRP: -83.89 at 34; neighbor 737 is lower by about 3 dB. So interference moderate.\n\nCould drop be due to high interference from non-colocated cells with same PCI mod 30? Not.\n\nWhat about C3: A neighboring cell provides higher throughput. Indeed when 919 serving, throughput low; when 737 serving, throughput high. So indeed a neighboring cell (737) provides higher performance. So maybe root cause: the neighbor cell (737) has better beam alignment or coverage, but the device is not handed over due to handover algorithm misconfiguration? But why drop <600? Actually 919 throughput low because neighbor 737 has better conditions; maybe interference still? But root cause likely C3: neighbor cell provides higher throughput.\n\nBut is that a root cause? The problem says \"reason for throughput dropping below 600Mbps in certain road sections.\" In data, when serving PCI 919 with low RSRP (80dBm) but neighbor 737 with slightly lower RSRP but similar throughput high: This suggests that cell 919's RSRP is borderline and throughput lower; but neighbor cell 737 provides higher throughput (when switched). So root cause may be that serving cell has weaker\n</think>\n"
