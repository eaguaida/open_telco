Option C is supply data to notification endpoints: That might be Notify or event notification. Option D is fetch data: That might be Get. So answer is B.\n\nBut let's confirm: The question: \"What is the purpose of the Nmfaf_3daDataManagement_Deconfigure service operation?\" In 3GPP Release 18, NMF-AF data management Deconfigure operation removes the mapping of data or analytics to outbound notification endpoints.

Let’s recall 3GPP Release 18 details: The Network Managed Functions (NMF) for 3D Analytics are called 3DA-analytics functions. The NMF-AF (MFAF) stands for Multi-Function Analytics Function. There's a data management service that includes operations: Register, Deregister, Configure, Deconfigure, Get, Put, etc. The Deconfigure operation likely stops the mapping or subscription of notifications. Option B says \"To configure the MFAF to stop mapping data or analytics received by the MFAF to out-bound notification endpoints.\" That sounds like Deconfigure. Option A is the configure operation. Option C is supply data to notification endpoints: That might be Notify or event notification. Option D is fetch data: That might be Get. So answer is B.\n\nBut let's confirm: The question: \"What is the purpose of the Nmfaf_3daDataManagement_Deconfigure service operation?\" In 3GPP Release 18, NMF-AF data management Deconfigure operation removes the mapping of data or analytics to outbound notification endpoints. Therefore B. There's no confusion.\n\nThus answer: B.\n\nMake sure to format last line: 'ANSWER: B'.\n\nLet's output.",

The question says \"utilizes the low-complexity message passing algorithm at the receiver for user data detection\". Which scheme uses MPA? SCMA uses message passing algorithm. But the question may be referencing \"MUS\". Let's analyze.\n\nSCMA is based on sparse codebook and uses message passing algorithm (MPA) for multi-user detection. Also SCMA uses MPA. MUSA may use matched filter or turbo? No, MUSA uses multi-user spreading; user data detection uses successive interference cancellation (SIC) or something similar. PDMA uses pattern mapping but typically use iterative detection and decoding; maybe MPA also used? I think PDMA uses MPA? Wait, we need to recall specifics.\n\nNon-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) schemes include SCMA, PDMA, MUSA, and others. SCMA is explicitly known for employing message passing algorithm (MPA) for detection. In SCMA, the detection complexity is lower because of message passing algorithm on factor graph representation caused by low-density codebooks. So I think the answer is E) SCMA.\n\nBut perhaps the question may refer to \"SCMA\" specifically. Let's examine each:\n\nA) NOMA: general concept, detection via SIC or MPA depending on scheme. But \"low-complexity MPA\" is not typical for NOMA but for SCMA. So exclude A.\n\nB) PDMA: Pattern division multiple access. I think PDMA uses \"iterative multi-user detection\" using \"low-complexity detection algorithm\" maybe \"maximal ratio combining\" or \"belief propagation\"? But I'm not sure. Some literature says PDMA uses detection algorithm based on \"message passing algorithm\" as well. Let's search memory: The paper \"Pattern Division Multiple Access: Towards 5G: ...\"? It uses iterative detection and decoding via message passing algorithm (MPA). Actually I think PDMA uses \"low-complexity iterative detection algorithm based on message passing\", but I'm not certain. But SCMA's MPA is well-known; PDMA uses similar but maybe uses \"sum product algorithm\" or \"belief propagation\" on factor graph. But the question: \"utilizes the low-complexity message passing algorithm at the receiver for user data detection?\" That is SCMA. The others may also be used but SCMA is singled out.\n\nLet’s verify: SCMA detection uses message passing algorithm (MPA). MUSA uses multi-user spreading with near-orthogonal sequences. It uses \"SIC\" or \"multi-user detection using matched filter\" or \"maximum likelihood detection,\" not message passing. MUST: Multi-User Superposition Transmission: uses successive interference cancellation. PDMA: Pattern Division, uses \"pattern mapping\" and detection may use \"maximal ratio combining\" and \"SIC.\" But not message passing? Possibly uses \"SCMA-like\" detection? Let's quickly check by memory:\n\n- SCMA: Use sparse codebook; detection via message passing algorithm.\n- PDMA: Pattern mapping across multiple subcarriers. The detection algorithm is based on \"iterative detection using message passing algorithm.\" Wait, but I recall PDMA uses \"factor graph\" maybe also uses MPA. However, the hallmark of SCMA is the use of MPA due to codebook sparsity. PDMA also uses message passing algorithm but with extra pattern. But I recall reading \"PDMA uses the Message Passing Algorithm (MPA) for signal detection.\" But we need to be careful.\n\nHold on: Which scheme specifically says \"low complexity message passing algorithm\"? The phrase \"low-complexity message passing algorithm\" is used in SCMA research: \"SCMA uses the message passing algorithm at the receiver for multiuser detection due to its sparse nature.\" The factor graph is used to simplify detection. So the phrase might indicate SCMA.\n\nThus answer likely E.\n\nDouble-check: \"Which non-orthogonal multiple access scheme utilizes the low-complexity message passing algorithm at the receiver for user data detection?\" The best candidate: SCMA. So answer E.\n\nThus final answer: ANSWER: E.",

I think PDMA uses \"iterative multi-user detection\" using \"low-complexity detection algorithm\" maybe \"maximal ratio combining\" or \"belief propagation\"? But I'm not sure. Some literature says PDMA uses detection algorithm based on \"message passing algorithm\" as well. Let's search memory: The paper \"Pattern Division Multiple Access: Towards 5G: ...\"? It uses iterative detection and decoding via message passing algorithm (MPA). Actually I think PDMA uses \"low-complexity iterative detection algorithm based on message passing\", but I'm not certain. But SCMA's MPA is well-known; PDMA uses similar but maybe uses \"sum product algorithm\" or \"belief propagation\" on factor graph. But the question: \"utilizes the low-complexity message passing algorithm at the receiver for user data detection?\" That is SCMA. The others may also be used but SCMA is singled out.\n\nLet’s verify: SCMA detection uses message passing algorithm (MPA). MUSA uses multi-user spreading with near-orthogonal sequences. It uses \"SIC\" or \"multi-user detection using matched filter\" or \"maximum likelihood detection,\" not message passing. MUST: Multi-User Superposition Transmission: uses successive interference cancellation. PDMA: Pattern Division, uses \"pattern mapping\" and detection may use \"maximal ratio combining\" and \"SIC.\" But not message passing? Possibly uses \"SCMA-like\" detection? Let's quickly check by memory:\n\n- SCMA: Use sparse codebook; detection via message passing algorithm.\n- PDMA: Pattern mapping across multiple subcarriers. The detection algorithm is based on \"iterative detection using message passing algorithm.\" Wait, but I recall PDMA uses \"factor graph\" maybe also uses MPA. However, the hallmark of SCMA is the use of MPA due to codebook sparsity. PDMA also uses message passing algorithm but with extra pattern. But I recall reading \"PDMA uses the Message Passing Algorithm (MPA) for signal detection.\" But we need to be careful.\n\nHold on: Which scheme specifically says \"low complexity message passing algorithm\"? The phrase \"low-complexity message passing algorithm\" is used in SCMA research: \"SCMA uses the message passing algorithm at the receiver for multiuser detection due to its sparse nature.\" The factor graph is used to simplify detection. So the phrase might indicate SCMA.\n\nThus answer likely E.\n\nDouble-check: \"Which non-orthogonal multiple access scheme utilizes the low-complexity message passing algorithm at the receiver for user data detection?\" The best candidate: SCMA. So answer E.\n\nThus final answer: ANSWER: E.",

        "3d68cf8a83469061e2741c5c46ef23f5": "We need to pick which non-orthogonal multiple access scheme uses low-complexity message passing algorithm at the receiver for user data detection.\n\nLet's recall: NOMA: general concept. PDMA (pattern division multiple access). MUSA: multi-user spreading multiple access. MUST: multi-user superposition transmission. SCMA: sparse code multiple access. The question says \"utilizes the low-complexity message passing algorithm at the receiver for user data detection\". Which scheme uses MPA? SCMA uses message passing algorithm. But the question may be referencing \"MUS\". Let's analyze.\n\nSCMA is based on sparse codebook and uses message passing algorithm (MPA) for multi-user detection. Also SCMA uses MPA. MUSA may use matched filter or turbo? No, MUSA uses multi-user spreading; user data detection uses successive interference cancellation (SIC) or something similar. PDMA uses pattern mapping but typically use iterative detection and decoding; maybe MPA also used? I think PDMA uses MPA? Wait, we need to recall specifics.\n\nNon-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) schemes include SCMA, PDMA, MUSA, and others. SCMA is explicitly known for employing message passing algorithm (MPA) for detection. In SCMA, the detection complexity is lower because of message passing algorithm on factor graph representation caused by low-density codebooks. So I think the answer is E) SCMA.\n\nBut perhaps the question may refer to \"SCMA\" specifically. Let's examine each:\n\nA) NOMA: general concept, detection via SIC or MPA depending on scheme. But \"low-complexity MPA\" is not typical for NOMA but for SCMA. So exclude A.\n\nB) PDMA: Pattern division multiple access. I think PDMA uses \"iterative multi-user detection\" using \"low-complexity detection algorithm\" maybe \"maximal ratio combining\" or \"belief propagation\"? But I'm not sure. Some literature says PDMA uses detection algorithm based on \"message passing algorithm\" as well. Let's search memory: The paper \"Pattern Division Multiple Access: Towards 5G: ...\"? It uses iterative detection and decoding via message passing algorithm (MPA). Actually I think PDMA uses \"low-complexity iterative detection algorithm based on message passing\", but I'm not certain. But SCMA's MPA is well-known; PDMA uses similar but maybe uses \"sum product algorithm\" or \"belief propagation\" on factor graph. But the question: \"utilizes the low-complexity message passing algorithm at the receiver for user data detection?\" That is SCMA. The others may also be used but SCMA is singled out.\n\nLet’s verify: SCMA detection uses message passing algorithm (MPA). MUSA uses multi-user spreading with near-orthogonal sequences. It uses \"SIC\" or \"multi-user detection using matched filter\" or \"maximum likelihood detection,\" not message passing. MUST: Multi-User Superposition Transmission: uses successive interference cancellation. PDMA: Pattern Division, uses \"pattern mapping\" and detection may use \"maximal ratio combining\" and \"SIC.\" But not message passing? Possibly uses \"SCMA-like\" detection? Let's quickly check by memory:\n\n- SCMA: Use sparse codebook; detection via message passing algorithm.\n- PDMA: Pattern mapping across multiple subcarriers. The detection algorithm is based on \"iterative detection using message passing algorithm.\" Wait, but I recall PDMA uses \"factor graph\" maybe also uses MPA. However, the hallmark of SCMA is the use of MPA due to codebook sparsity. PDMA also uses message passing algorithm but with extra pattern. But I recall reading \"PDMA uses the Message Passing Algorithm (MPA) for signal detection.\" But we need to be careful.\n\nHold on: Which scheme specifically says \"low complexity message passing algorithm\"? The phrase \"low-complexity message passing algorithm\" is used in SCMA research: \"SCMA uses the message passing algorithm at the receiver for multiuser detection due to its sparse nature.\" The factor graph is used to simplify detection. So the phrase might indicate SCMA.\n\nThus answer likely E.\n\nDouble-check: \"Which non-orthogonal multiple access scheme utilizes the low-complexity message passing algorithm at the receiver for user data detection?\" The best candidate: SCMA. So answer E.\n\nThus final answer: ANSWER: E.",
